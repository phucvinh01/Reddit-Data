Godzilla 2014 deserved better sequels.,maruhadapurpurine,262,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1d5yorj/godzilla_2014_deserved_better_sequels/,121,"I finally got around to watching those monsterverse movies this week and boy... how did they manage to peak right at the start?

The 2014 movie is so vastly above the sequels in tone and quality that it's hard to believe they belong in the same continuity. Godzilla 2014 is as grounded as a story about a giant lizard monster fighting other giant monsters can be. The human element is much simpler and easier to empathize with. The effects feel years ahead of what came after too. The destruction caused by the monsters fighting feel appropriately bleak while also being super awesome to watch.

I don't think any moment in the sequels ever got me nearly as hyped as when Godzilla shoots his atomic breath down the MUTO's throat. Hell even his first full appearance at Hawaii got me more hyped than anything in the sequels to be honest.

Yeah, I will be the first to agree that for a Godzilla movie there isn't nearly enough Godzilla in it, but maybe they were on to something by keeping his presence so brief until later. The sequels have monsters galore and they're no better for it.

The whole time watching King of the Monsters I was only ever mildly amused by all of it. Gidorah just looked goofy as fuck most of the time because it clashes so much with the semi realism that Godzilla was designed with. The human plot is absolutely awful and should have been cut down by a lot.

Godzilla vs Kong is alright... Sure the fight scenes are cool, but once again the human characters detract way more than add anything to it, especially the podcast guy and the kids. Why are they even here? The stranger things girl's story was over already, why is she back?

And the sci-fi shit was already too much last movie, in this one they just jump the shark completely. It's like they couldn't figure out how to keep the story going so the movies just got progressively dumber with each entry, like a kid mashing toys together. Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy a movie like that, but when you compare it with the 2014 movie it is just so disappointing to see such a major departure in direction. It's like they lost the plot.

Kong Skull Island was fun though. Nice twist to have Samual L Jackson as the villain. I would rank this one just below Godzilla 2014. Even if the tone between them is still completely different at least Skull Island managed to keep itself together by succeeding in the same areas that Godzilla did. Straightforward, centered plot, the human characters contribute to the story instead of detracting from it, great action scenes.

The only one left is Godzilla x Kong and I'm already not expecting anything aside some dumb but fun fight scenes, and just hoping the human characters are cut down to a minimum.

On a side note I also watched Shin Godzilla and will watch Godzilla Minus One as well. The take is so different you can't even really compare them. Shin Godzilla is much more of a political commentary on the japanese government than anything else. I guess that keeps the line much closer to the OG Godzilla movie.

Edit: I finished watching Minus One and GxK The New Empire so here are my brief thoughts.

Minus One: Obviously not related to the monsterverse but it pretty much nails the human element in a Godzilla movie. Even when you know where te story is going it still hits the emotional notes. Because of that I would say it is overall better than the 2014 version (though I would still say that 2014 has better hype moments. You just can't top that atomic breath straight down the MUTO's mouth.)

GxK: This movie is completely ridiculous in every way possible and it just cemented my thoughts on this. Regardless of what I think about the quality of the sequels, these movies absolutely shouldn't be in the same universe. The tone is too different, the world is simply not the same. There is no way you can watch GxK and then look at 2014 Godzilla and say they fit together. It just doesn't work. Again, I'm not against movies like this. They have an audience, and I can honestly say I had some fun watching it, but it should've been its own thing and not related to the 2014 movie, which in turn deserved a sequel much more in line with its tone and vision of the Godzilla universe.",1717281094.0,Text

Forging A Return to Productive Conversation: An Open Letter to Reddit,Funny_Sentinel,1196,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/14jmh7e/forging_a_return_to_productive_conversation_an/,1,"To All Whom It May Concern:

For fifteen years, /r/Funny has been one of Reddit’s most-popular communities. That time hasn’t been without its difficulties, but for the most part, we’ve all gotten along (with each other and with administrators). Members of our team fondly remember Moderator Roadshows, visits to Reddit’s headquarters, Reddit Secret Santa, April Fools’ Day events, regional meetups, and many more uplifting moments. We’ve watched this platform grow by leaps and bounds, and although we haven’t been completely happy about every change that we’ve witnessed, we’ve always done our best to work with Reddit at finding ways to adapt, compromise, and move forward. 

This process has occasionally been preceded by some exceptionally public debate, however.

On June 12th, 2023, /r/Funny joined thousands of other subreddits in protesting the planned changes to Reddit’s API; changes which – despite being immediately evident to only a minority of Redditors – threatened to worsen the site for everyone. By June 16th, 2023, that demonstration had evolved to represent a wider (and growing) array of concerns, many of which arose in response to [Reddit’s statements to journalists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/16/reddit-ceo-blackout-moderators-steve-huffman/). Today (June 26th, 2023), we are hopeful that users and administrators alike can make a return to the productive dialogue that has served us in the past. 

We acknowledge that Reddit has placed itself in a situation that makes adjusting its current API roadmap impossible. 

However, we have the following requests:

- Commit to exploring ways by which third-party applications can make an affordable return.
- Commit to providing moderation tools and [accessibility options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/) (on Old Reddit, New Reddit, and mobile platforms) which match or exceed the functionality and utility of third-party applications.
- Commit to prioritizing a significant reduction in spam, misinformation, bigotry, and illegal content on Reddit.
- Guarantee that any future developments which may impact moderators, contributors, or stakeholders will be announced no less than one fiscal quarter before they are scheduled to go into effect.
- Work together with longstanding moderators to establish a reasonable roadmap and deadline for accomplishing all of the above.
- Affirm that efforts meant to keep Reddit accountable to its commitments and deadlines will hereafter not be met with insults, threats, removals, or hostility.
- Publicly affirm all of the above by way of updating Reddit’s User Agreement and Reddit’s Moderator Code of Conduct to include reasonable expectations and requirements for administrators’ behavior. 
- Implement and fill a senior-level role (with decision-making and policy-shaping power) of ""Moderator Advocate"" at Reddit, with a required qualification for the position being robust experience as a volunteer Reddit moderator.

Reddit is unique amongst social-media sites in that its lifeblood – its multitude of moderators and contributors – consists entirely of volunteers. We populate and curate the platform’s many communities, thereby providing a welcoming and engaging environment for all of its visitors. We receive little in the way of thanks for these efforts, but we frequently endure abuse, threats, attacks, and exposure to truly reprehensible media. Historically, we have trusted that Reddit’s administrators have the best interests of the platform and its users (be they moderators, contributors, participants, or lurkers) at heart; that while Reddit may be a for-profit company, it nonetheless recognizes and appreciates the value that Redditors provide. 

That trust has been all but entirely eroded… but we hope that together, we can begin to rebuild it.

In simplest terms, Reddit, we implore you: **Remember the human**. 

We look forward to your response by Thursday, June 29th, 2023.

Godzilla 2014 deserved better sequels.,maruhadapurpurine,267,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1d5yorj/godzilla_2014_deserved_better_sequels/,121,"I finally got around to watching those monsterverse movies this week and boy... how did they manage to peak right at the start?

The 2014 movie is so vastly above the sequels in tone and quality that it's hard to believe they belong in the same continuity. Godzilla 2014 is as grounded as a story about a giant lizard monster fighting other giant monsters can be. The human element is much simpler and easier to empathize with. The effects feel years ahead of what came after too. The destruction caused by the monsters fighting feel appropriately bleak while also being super awesome to watch.

I don't think any moment in the sequels ever got me nearly as hyped as when Godzilla shoots his atomic breath down the MUTO's throat. Hell even his first full appearance at Hawaii got me more hyped than anything in the sequels to be honest.

Yeah, I will be the first to agree that for a Godzilla movie there isn't nearly enough Godzilla in it, but maybe they were on to something by keeping his presence so brief until later. The sequels have monsters galore and they're no better for it.

The whole time watching King of the Monsters I was only ever mildly amused by all of it. Gidorah just looked goofy as fuck most of the time because it clashes so much with the semi realism that Godzilla was designed with. The human plot is absolutely awful and should have been cut down by a lot.

Godzilla vs Kong is alright... Sure the fight scenes are cool, but once again the human characters detract way more than add anything to it, especially the podcast guy and the kids. Why are they even here? The stranger things girl's story was over already, why is she back?

And the sci-fi shit was already too much last movie, in this one they just jump the shark completely. It's like they couldn't figure out how to keep the story going so the movies just got progressively dumber with each entry, like a kid mashing toys together. Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy a movie like that, but when you compare it with the 2014 movie it is just so disappointing to see such a major departure in direction. It's like they lost the plot.

Kong Skull Island was fun though. Nice twist to have Samual L Jackson as the villain. I would rank this one just below Godzilla 2014. Even if the tone between them is still completely different at least Skull Island managed to keep itself together by succeeding in the same areas that Godzilla did. Straightforward, centered plot, the human characters contribute to the story instead of detracting from it, great action scenes.

The only one left is Godzilla x Kong and I'm already not expecting anything aside some dumb but fun fight scenes, and just hoping the human characters are cut down to a minimum.

On a side note I also watched Shin Godzilla and will watch Godzilla Minus One as well. The take is so different you can't even really compare them. Shin Godzilla is much more of a political commentary on the japanese government than anything else. I guess that keeps the line much closer to the OG Godzilla movie.

Edit: I finished watching Minus One and GxK The New Empire so here are my brief thoughts.

Minus One: Obviously not related to the monsterverse but it pretty much nails the human element in a Godzilla movie. Even when you know where te story is going it still hits the emotional notes. Because of that I would say it is overall better than the 2014 version (though I would still say that 2014 has better hype moments. You just can't top that atomic breath straight down the MUTO's mouth.)

GxK: This movie is completely ridiculous in every way possible and it just cemented my thoughts on this. Regardless of what I think about the quality of the sequels, these movies absolutely shouldn't be in the same universe. The tone is too different, the world is simply not the same. There is no way you can watch GxK and then look at 2014 Godzilla and say they fit together. It just doesn't work. Again, I'm not against movies like this. They have an audience, and I can honestly say I had some fun watching it, but it should've been its own thing and not related to the 2014 movie, which in turn deserved a sequel much more in line with its tone and vision of the Godzilla universe.",1717281094.0,Text

The whole time watching King of the Monsters I was only ever mildly amused by all of it. Gidorah just looked goofy as fuck most of the time because it clashes so much with the semi realism that Godzilla was designed with. The human plot is absolutely awful and should have been cut down by a lot.

Godzilla vs Kong is alright... Sure the fight scenes are cool, but once again the human characters detract way more than add anything to it, especially the podcast guy and the kids. Why are they even here? The stranger things girl's story was over already, why is she back?

And the sci-fi shit was already too much last movie, in this one they just jump the shark completely. It's like they couldn't figure out how to keep the story going so the movies just got progressively dumber with each entry, like a kid mashing toys together. Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy a movie like that, but when you compare it with the 2014 movie it is just so disappointing to see such a major departure in direction. It's like they lost the plot.

Kong Skull Island was fun though. Nice twist to have Samual L Jackson as the villain. I would rank this one just below Godzilla 2014. Even if the tone between them is still completely different at least Skull Island managed to keep itself together by succeeding in the same areas that Godzilla did. Straightforward, centered plot, the human characters contribute to the story instead of detracting from it, great action scenes.

The only one left is Godzilla x Kong and I'm already not expecting anything aside some dumb but fun fight scenes, and just hoping the human characters are cut down to a minimum.

On a side note I also watched Shin Godzilla and will watch Godzilla Minus One as well. The take is so different you can't even really compare them. Shin Godzilla is much more of a political commentary on the japanese government than anything else. I guess that keeps the line much closer to the OG Godzilla movie.

Edit: I finished watching Minus One and GxK The New Empire so here are my brief thoughts.

Minus One: Obviously not related to the monsterverse but it pretty much nails the human element in a Godzilla movie. Even when you know where te story is going it still hits the emotional notes. Because of that I would say it is overall better than the 2014 version (though I would still say that 2014 has better hype moments. You just can't top that atomic breath straight down the MUTO's mouth.)

GxK: This movie is completely ridiculous in every way possible and it just cemented my thoughts on this. Regardless of what I think about the quality of the sequels, these movies absolutely shouldn't be in the same universe. The tone is too different, the world is simply not the same. There is no way you can watch GxK and then look at 2014 Godzilla and say they fit together. It just doesn't work. Again, I'm not against movies like this. They have an audience, and I can honestly say I had some fun watching it, but it should've been its own thing and not related to the 2014 movie, which in turn deserved a sequel much more in line with its tone and vision of the Godzilla universe.",1717281094.0,Text
What’s your go-to movie when you’re sick?,crimson_dovah,157,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1d613rp/whats_your_goto_movie_when_youre_sick/,208,"Since I first watched it, it’s been Rob Reiners, *“The Princess Bride”*.

Not only are they annoying, but 99 times out of 100 they are also just bad videos, and, unfortunately, there is a very large overlap between the sorts of people who want to use AI to make their Youtube video, and the sorts of people who'll pay for a botnet to upvote it on Reddit.

So, starting today, we're proposing a full ban on low effort AI generated content. As mods we often already remove these, but we don't catch them all. You will soon be able to report both posts and comments as 'AI' and we'll remove them.

There will, however, be a few small exceptions. **All of which must have the new AI flair applied** (_which we will sort out in the coming couple days - a little flair housekeeping to do first_).

Some examples:

- Use of the tech in collaboration with a strong human element, e.g. creating a cartoon where AI has been used to help generate the video element based on a human-written script. 
- Demonstrations the progress of the technology (e.g. [Introducing Sora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK6y8DAPN_0))
- Satire that is actually funny (e.g. [satirical adverts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSewd6Iaj6I), deepfakes that are obvious and amusing) - though remember Rule 2, NO POLITICS
- Artistic pieces that aren't just crummy visualisers 

All of this will be up to the r/videos denizens, if we see an AI piece in the new queue that meets the above exceptions and is getting strongly upvoted, so long as is properly identified, it can stay.

The vast majority of AI videos we've seen so far though, do not.

Washington D.C.

My very dear Sarah:

The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days—perhaps tomorrow. Lest I should not be able to write you again, I feel impelled to write lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more.

Our movement may be one of a few days duration and full of pleasure—and it may be one of severe conflict and death to me. Not my will, but thine O God, be done. If it is necessary that I should fall on the battlefield for my country, I am ready. I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in, the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how strongly American Civilization now leans upon the triumph of the Government, and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the Revolution. And I am willing—perfectly willing—to lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this Government, and to pay that debt.


But, my dear wife, when I know that with my own joys I lay down nearly all of yours, and replace them in this life with cares and sorrows—when, after having eaten for long years the bitter fruit of orphanage myself, I must offer it as their only sustenance to my dear little children—is it weak or dishonorable, while the banner of my purpose floats calmly and proudly in the breeze, that my unbounded love for you, my darling wife and children, should struggle in fierce, though useless, contest with my love of country.

Sarah, my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me to you with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break; and yet my love of Country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on with all these chains to the battlefield.

The memories of the blissful moments I have spent with you come creeping over me, and I feel most gratified to God and to you that I have enjoyed them so long. And hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years, when God willing, we might still have lived and loved together and seen our sons grow up to honorable manhood around us. I have, I know, but few and small claims upon Divine Providence, but something whispers to me—perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar—that I shall return to my loved ones unharmed. If I do not, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, and when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name.

Forgive my many faults, and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless and foolish I have often been! How gladly would I wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness, and struggle with all the misfortune of this world, to shield you and my children from harm. But I cannot. I must watch you from the spirit land and hover near you, while you buffet the storms with your precious little freight, and wait with sad patience till we meet to part no more.

But, O Sarah! If the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you; in the brightest day and in the darkest night—amidst your happiest scenes and gloomiest hours—always, always; and if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shall be my breath; or the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by.

Sarah, do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for thee, for we shall meet again.
As for my little boys, they will grow as I have done, and never know a father's love and care. Little Willie is too young to remember me long, and my blue-eyed Edgar will keep my frolics with him among the dimmest memories of his childhood. Sarah, I have unlimited confidence in your maternal care and your development of their characters. Tell my two mothers his and hers I call God's blessing upon them. O Sarah, I wait for you there! Come to me, and lead thither my children.

Little Willie is too young to remember me long, and my blue-eyed Edgar will keep my frolics with him among the dimmest memories of his childhood. Sarah, I have unlimited confidence in your maternal care and your development of their characters. Tell my two mothers his and hers I call God's blessing upon them. O Sarah, I wait for you there! Come to me, and lead thither my children.

Announcing a ban on AI generated videos (with a few exceptions),ianjm,1847,https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1cg9nud/announcing_a_ban_on_ai_generated_videos_with_a/,279,"Howdy r/videos,

We all know the robots are coming for our jobs and our lives - but now they're coming for our subreddit too.

Multiple videos that have weird scripts that sound like they've come straight out of a kindergartener's thesaurus now regularly show up in the new queue, and all of them voiced by those same slightly off-putting set of cheap or free AI voice clones that everyone is using.

Not only are they annoying, but 99 times out of 100 they are also just bad videos, and, unfortunately, there is a very large overlap between the sorts of people who want to use AI to make their Youtube video, and the sorts of people who'll pay for a botnet to upvote it on Reddit.

So, starting today, we're proposing a full ban on low effort AI generated content. As mods we often already remove these, but we don't catch them all. You will soon be able to report both posts and comments as 'AI' and we'll remove them.

There will, however, be a few small exceptions. **All of which must have the new AI flair applied** (_which we will sort out in the coming couple days - a little flair housekeeping to do first_).

Some examples:

- Use of the tech in collaboration with a strong human element, e.g. creating a cartoon where AI has been used to help generate the video element based on a human-written script. 
- Demonstrations the progress of the technology (e.g. [Introducing Sora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK6y8DAPN_0))
- Satire that is actually funny (e.g. [satirical adverts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSewd6Iaj6I), deepfakes that are obvious and amusing) - though remember Rule 2, NO POLITICS
- Artistic pieces that aren't just crummy visualisers 

All of this will be up to the r/videos denizens, if we see an AI piece in the new queue that meets the above exceptions and is getting strongly upvoted, so long as is properly identified, it can stay.

The vast majority of AI videos we've seen so far though, do not.

Thanks, we hope this makes sense.

**Feedback welcome! If you have any suggestions about this policy, or just want to call the mods a bunch of assholes, now is your chance.**",1714422897.0,Text

""July the 14th, 1861

Washington D.C.

My very dear Sarah:

The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days—perhaps tomorrow. Lest I should not be able to write you again, I feel impelled to write lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more.

Our movement may be one of a few days duration and full of pleasure—and it may be one of severe conflict and death to me. Not my will, but thine O God, be done. If it is necessary that I should fall on the battlefield for my country, I am ready. I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in, the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how strongly American Civilization now leans upon the triumph of the Government, and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the Revolution. And I am willing—perfectly willing—to lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this Government, and to pay that debt.


But, my dear wife, when I know that with my own joys I lay down nearly all of yours, and replace them in this life with cares and sorrows—when, after having eaten for long years the bitter fruit of orphanage myself, I must offer it as their only sustenance to my dear little children—is it weak or dishonorable, while the banner of my purpose floats calmly and proudly in the breeze, that my unbounded love for you, my darling wife and children, should struggle in fierce, though useless, contest with my love of country.

Sarah, my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me to you with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break; and yet my love of Country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on with all these chains to the battlefield.

The memories of the blissful moments I have spent with you come creeping over me, and I feel most gratified to God and to you that I have enjoyed them so long. And hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years, when God willing, we might still have lived and loved together and seen our sons grow up to honorable manhood around us. I have, I know, but few and small claims upon Divine Providence, but something whispers to me—perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar—that I shall return to my loved ones unharmed. If I do not, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, and when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name.

Forgive my many faults, and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless and foolish I have often been! How gladly would I wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness, and struggle with all the misfortune of this world, to shield you and my children from harm. But I cannot. I must watch you from the spirit land and hover near you, while you buffet the storms with your precious little freight, and wait with sad patience till we meet to part no more.

But, O Sarah! If the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you; in the brightest day and in the darkest night—amidst your happiest scenes and gloomiest hours—always, always; and if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shall be my breath; or the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by.

Sarah, do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for thee, for we shall meet again.
As for my little boys, they will grow as I have done, and never know a father's love and care. Little Willie is too young to remember me long, and my blue-eyed Edgar will keep my frolics with him among the dimmest memories of his childhood. Sarah, I have unlimited confidence in your maternal care and your development of their characters. Tell my two mothers his and hers I call God's blessing upon them. O Sarah, I wait for you there! Come to me, and lead thither my children.

Forging A Return to Productive Conversation: An Open Letter to Reddit,Funny_Sentinel,1196,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/14jmh7e/forging_a_return_to_productive_conversation_an/,1,"To All Whom It May Concern:

For fifteen years, /r/Funny has been one of Reddit’s most-popular communities. That time hasn’t been without its difficulties, but for the most part, we’ve all gotten along (with each other and with administrators). Members of our team fondly remember Moderator Roadshows, visits to Reddit’s headquarters, Reddit Secret Santa, April Fools’ Day events, regional meetups, and many more uplifting moments. We’ve watched this platform grow by leaps and bounds, and although we haven’t been completely happy about every change that we’ve witnessed, we’ve always done our best to work with Reddit at finding ways to adapt, compromise, and move forward. 

This process has occasionally been preceded by some exceptionally public debate, however.

On June 12th, 2023, /r/Funny joined thousands of other subreddits in protesting the planned changes to Reddit’s API; changes which – despite being immediately evident to only a minority of Redditors – threatened to worsen the site for everyone. By June 16th, 2023, that demonstration had evolved to represent a wider (and growing) array of concerns, many of which arose in response to [Reddit’s statements to journalists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/16/reddit-ceo-blackout-moderators-steve-huffman/). Today (June 26th, 2023), we are hopeful that users and administrators alike can make a return to the productive dialogue that has served us in the past. 

We acknowledge that Reddit has placed itself in a situation that makes adjusting its current API roadmap impossible. 

However, we have the following requests:

- Commit to exploring ways by which third-party applications can make an affordable return.
- Commit to providing moderation tools and [accessibility options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/) (on Old Reddit, New Reddit, and mobile platforms) which match or exceed the functionality and utility of third-party applications.
- Commit to prioritizing a significant reduction in spam, misinformation, bigotry, and illegal content on Reddit.
- Guarantee that any future developments which may impact moderators, contributors, or stakeholders will be announced no less than one fiscal quarter before they are scheduled to go into effect.
- Work together with longstanding moderators to establish a reasonable roadmap and deadline for accomplishing all of the above.
- Affirm that efforts meant to keep Reddit accountable to its commitments and deadlines will hereafter not be met with insults, threats, removals, or hostility.
- Publicly affirm all of the above by way of updating Reddit’s User Agreement and Reddit’s Moderator Code of Conduct to include reasonable expectations and requirements for administrators’ behavior. 
- Implement and fill a senior-level role (with decision-making and policy-shaping power) of ""Moderator Advocate"" at Reddit, with a required qualification for the position being robust experience as a volunteer Reddit moderator.

Reddit is unique amongst social-media sites in that its lifeblood – its multitude of moderators and contributors – consists entirely of volunteers. We populate and curate the platform’s many communities, thereby providing a welcoming and engaging environment for all of its visitors. We receive little in the way of thanks for these efforts, but we frequently endure abuse, threats, attacks, and exposure to truly reprehensible media. Historically, we have trusted that Reddit’s administrators have the best interests of the platform and its users (be they moderators, contributors, participants, or lurkers) at heart; that while Reddit may be a for-profit company, it nonetheless recognizes and appreciates the value that Redditors provide. 

That trust has been all but entirely eroded… but we hope that together, we can begin to rebuild it.

In simplest terms, Reddit, we implore you: **Remember the human**. 

We look forward to your response by Thursday, June 29th, 2023.

Godzilla 2014 deserved better sequels.,maruhadapurpurine,260,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1d5yorj/godzilla_2014_deserved_better_sequels/,121,"I finally got around to watching those monsterverse movies this week and boy... how did they manage to peak right at the start?

The 2014 movie is so vastly above the sequels in tone and quality that it's hard to believe they belong in the same continuity. Godzilla 2014 is as grounded as a story about a giant lizard monster fighting other giant monsters can be. The human element is much simpler and easier to empathize with. The effects feel years ahead of what came after too. The destruction caused by the monsters fighting feel appropriately bleak while also being super awesome to watch.

I don't think any moment in the sequels ever got me nearly as hyped as when Godzilla shoots his atomic breath down the MUTO's throat. Hell even his first full appearance at Hawaii got me more hyped than anything in the sequels to be honest.

Yeah, I will be the first to agree that for a Godzilla movie there isn't nearly enough Godzilla in it, but maybe they were on to something by keeping his presence so brief until later. The sequels have monsters galore and they're no better for it.

The whole time watching King of the Monsters I was only ever mildly amused by all of it. Gidorah just looked goofy as fuck most of the time because it clashes so much with the semi realism that Godzilla was designed with. The human plot is absolutely awful and should have been cut down by a lot.

Godzilla vs Kong is alright... Sure the fight scenes are cool, but once again the human characters detract way more than add anything to it, especially the podcast guy and the kids. Why are they even here? The stranger things girl's story was over already, why is she back?

And the sci-fi shit was already too much last movie, in this one they just jump the shark completely. It's like they couldn't figure out how to keep the story going so the movies just got progressively dumber with each entry, like a kid mashing toys together. Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy a movie like that, but when you compare it with the 2014 movie it is just so disappointing to see such a major departure in direction. It's like they lost the plot.

Kong Skull Island was fun though. Nice twist to have Samual L Jackson as the villain. I would rank this one just below Godzilla 2014. Even if the tone between them is still completely different at least Skull Island managed to keep itself together by succeeding in the same areas that Godzilla did. Straightforward, centered plot, the human characters contribute to the story instead of detracting from it, great action scenes.

The only one left is Godzilla x Kong and I'm already not expecting anything aside some dumb but fun fight scenes, and just hoping the human characters are cut down to a minimum.

On a side note I also watched Shin Godzilla and will watch Godzilla Minus One as well. The take is so different you can't even really compare them. Shin Godzilla is much more of a political commentary on the japanese government than anything else. I guess that keeps the line much closer to the OG Godzilla movie.

Edit: I finished watching Minus One and GxK The New Empire so here are my brief thoughts.

Minus One: Obviously not related to the monsterverse but it pretty much nails the human element in a Godzilla movie. Even when you know where te story is going it still hits the emotional notes. Because of that I would say it is overall better than the 2014 version (though I would still say that 2014 has better hype moments. You just can't top that atomic breath straight down the MUTO's mouth.)

GxK: This movie is completely ridiculous in every way possible and it just cemented my thoughts on this. Regardless of what I think about the quality of the sequels, these movies absolutely shouldn't be in the same universe. The tone is too different, the world is simply not the same. There is no way you can watch GxK and then look at 2014 Godzilla and say they fit together. It just doesn't work. Again, I'm not against movies like this. They have an audience, and I can honestly say I had some fun watching it, but it should've been its own thing and not related to the 2014 movie, which in turn deserved a sequel much more in line with its tone and vision of the Godzilla universe.",1717281094.0,Text

Announcing a ban on AI generated videos (with a few exceptions),ianjm,1849,https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1cg9nud/announcing_a_ban_on_ai_generated_videos_with_a/,279,"Howdy r/videos,

We all know the robots are coming for our jobs and our lives - but now they're coming for our subreddit too.

Multiple videos that have weird scripts that sound like they've come straight out of a kindergartener's thesaurus now regularly show up in the new queue, and all of them voiced by those same slightly off-putting set of cheap or free AI voice clones that everyone is using.

Not only are they annoying, but 99 times out of 100 they are also just bad videos, and, unfortunately, there is a very large overlap between the sorts of people who want to use AI to make their Youtube video, and the sorts of people who'll pay for a botnet to upvote it on Reddit.

So, starting today, we're proposing a full ban on low effort AI generated content. As mods we often already remove these, but we don't catch them all. You will soon be able to report both posts and comments as 'AI' and we'll remove them.

There will, however, be a few small exceptions. **All of which must have the new AI flair applied** (_which we will sort out in the coming couple days - a little flair housekeeping to do first_).

Some examples:

- Use of the tech in collaboration with a strong human element, e.g. creating a cartoon where AI has been used to help generate the video element based on a human-written script. 
- Demonstrations the progress of the technology (e.g. [Introducing Sora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK6y8DAPN_0))
- Satire that is actually funny (e.g. [satirical adverts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSewd6Iaj6I), deepfakes that are obvious and amusing) - though remember Rule 2, NO POLITICS
- Artistic pieces that aren't just crummy visualisers 

All of this will be up to the r/videos denizens, if we see an AI piece in the new queue that meets the above exceptions and is getting strongly upvoted, so long as is properly identified, it can stay.

The vast majority of AI videos we've seen so far though, do not.

Thanks, we hope this makes sense.

**Feedback welcome! If you have any suggestions about this policy, or just want to call the mods a bunch of assholes, now is your chance.**",1714422897.0,Text

""July the 14th, 1861

Washington D.C.

My very dear Sarah:

The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days—perhaps tomorrow. Lest I should not be able to write you again, I feel impelled to write lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more.

Our movement may be one of a few days duration and full of pleasure—and it may be one of severe conflict and death to me. Not my will, but thine O God, be done. If it is necessary that I should fall on the battlefield for my country, I am ready. I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in, the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how strongly American Civilization now leans upon the triumph of the Government, and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the Revolution. And I am willing—perfectly willing—to lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this Government, and to pay that debt.


But, my dear wife, when I know that with my own joys I lay down nearly all of yours, and replace them in this life with cares and sorrows—when, after having eaten for long years the bitter fruit of orphanage myself, I must offer it as their only sustenance to my dear little children—is it weak or dishonorable, while the banner of my purpose floats calmly and proudly in the breeze, that my unbounded love for you, my darling wife and children, should struggle in fierce, though useless, contest with my love of country.

Sarah, my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me to you with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break; and yet my love of Country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on with all these chains to the battlefield.

The memories of the blissful moments I have spent with you come creeping over me, and I feel most gratified to God and to you that I have enjoyed them so long. And hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years, when God willing, we might still have lived and loved together and seen our sons grow up to honorable manhood around us. I have, I know, but few and small claims upon Divine Providence, but something whispers to me—perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar—that I shall return to my loved ones unharmed. If I do not, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, and when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name.

Forgive my many faults, and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless and foolish I have often been! How gladly would I wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness, and struggle with all the misfortune of this world, to shield you and my children from harm. But I cannot. I must watch you from the spirit land and hover near you, while you buffet the storms with your precious little freight, and wait with sad patience till we meet to part no more.

But, O Sarah! If the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you; in the brightest day and in the darkest night—amidst your happiest scenes and gloomiest hours—always, always; and if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shall be my breath; or the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by.

Sarah, do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for thee, for we shall meet again.
As for my little boys, they will grow as I have done, and never know a father's love and care. Little Willie is too young to remember me long, and my blue-eyed Edgar will keep my frolics with him among the dimmest memories of his childhood. Sarah, I have unlimited confidence in your maternal care and your development of their characters. Tell my two mothers his and hers I call God's blessing upon them. O Sarah, I wait for you there! Come to me, and lead thither my children.

"Debate, dissent, and protest on Reddit",spez,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/pbmy5y/debate_dissent_and_protest_on_reddit/,1,"Hey everyone–

The pandemic has been extremely hard on many of us. We believe the best way forward for everyone is to [get vaccinated](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) and continue to follow [CDC guidance on masking](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html). Throughout the pandemic, we have also provided COVID-related resources to support our volunteer moderators, users, and communities, including a dedicated AMA series connecting users with [authoritative experts on coronavirus](https://redditblog.com/2020/03/02/expert-conversation-on-coronavirus/) and [vaccines](https://redditblog.com/2021/01/28/introducing-a-new-reddit-ama-series-everything-you-want-to-know-about-covid-19-vaccines/), as well as deploying homepage and search page banners directing users to the CDC and r/Coronavirus.

We appreciate that not everyone agrees with the current approach to getting us all through the pandemic, and some are still wary of vaccinations. Dissent is a part of Reddit and the foundation of democracy. Reddit is a place for open and authentic discussion and debate. This includes conversations that question or disagree with popular consensus. This includes conversations that criticize those that disagree with the majority opinion. This includes protests that criticize or object to our decisions on which communities to ban from the platform.

While we appreciate the sentiment of those demanding that we ban more communities that challenge consensus views on the pandemic, we continue to believe in the good of our communities and hope that we collectively approach the challenges of the pandemic with empathy, compassion, and a willingness to understand what others are going through, even when their viewpoint on the pandemic is different from yours. 

When it comes to COVID-19 specifically, what we know and what are the current best practices from authoritative sources, like the CDC, evolve continuously with new learnings. Given the rapid state of change, we believe it is best to enable communities to engage in debate and dissent, and for us to link to the CDC wherever appropriate. While we believe the CDC is the best and most up to date source of information regarding COVID-19, disagreeing with them is not against our policies.

However, manipulating or cheating Reddit to amplify any particular viewpoint is against our policies, and we will continue to action communities that do so or that violate any of our other rules, including those dedicated to fraud (e.g. fake vaccine cards) or encouraging harm (e.g. consuming bleach); and we will continue to use our quarantine tool to link to authoritative sources and warn people they may encounter unsound advice. We humbly ask and encourage everyone to report content that may violate our policies.

\*We are using our [political ads system](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/ipitt0/today_were_testing_a_new_way_to_discuss_political/) to facilitate discussion of this post within the context of your own communities.",1629933302.0,Text

We will continue to run exchanges through the end of the year -- including the last ever Arbitrary Day (signups are [now open](https://www.redditgifts.com/exchanges/a-day-21/)) -- and will end with Secret Santa 2021. 

**We didn’t make this decision lightly.** 

We made the difficult decision to shut down Reddit Gifts and put more focus on enhancing the [user experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/mqcpcg/you_want_a_better_reddit_search_ok_were_on_it/) on Reddit - this includes [investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/ldgmfc/diamond_hands_on_the_data/) in the [foundation](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/nudfv1/the_rollout_of_reputation_service/) [of our](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/lb2p7a/a_new_video_player_updated_email_designs_mobile/) [platform](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/neknjg/evolving_beyond_100_billion_recommendations_a_day/) and [moderator tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/nk7p7j/new_updates_to_help_moderators_your_monthly/), making it more [accessible](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/mzse3p/control_over_your_followers_spring_avatar_gear_a/) for people around the world and evolving how people [engage](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/nmhmj0/q1_safety_security_report_may_27_2021/) with one another. 

The power of Reddit Gifts was never in the software, and has always belonged to the r/secretsanta community of gifters around the world, which has connected people and been an extension of our mission to bring community and belonging to everyone in the world. We’re hopeful that spirit will continue in the future. 

**What this means for future exchanges in 2021**

In preparation for retiring Reddit Gifts after the final exchange at the end of 2021, we will be taking the following actions: 

* In order to limit incomplete exchanges, we have disabled the creation of any new Reddit Gifts accounts. If you have an existing Reddit Gifts account, we would love it if you would participate with us in these final exchanges. 
* Any incomplete exchanges will result in a ban from the remaining Reddit Gifts exchanges.
* This morning, we turned off the ability to buy [Elves](https://www.redditgifts.com/Elves/). If you purchased an Elves membership and have remaining months after the 2021 Secret Santa Exchange, we will email you about your refund options then. If you have specific concerns about your Elves membership, please reach out to Reddit Gifts [support](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000825092). 

These changes have been put in place to ensure that these last exchanges are enjoyable for the legacy Reddit Gifts users. We want to celebrate the end of Reddit Gifts with the community that we’ve built so far. 

Countless acts of love, heroism, compassion, support, growth and hilarity happened through Reddit Gifts, and those memories will live on in the hearts of our community. We’re working on ways to capture these moments and look forward to seeing how the spirit and connection of exchanging gifts with strangers will live on.

An update on the recent issues surrounding a Reddit employee,spez,107366,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/mcisdf/an_update_on_the_recent_issues_surrounding_a/,36011,"We would like to give you all an update on the recent issues that have transpired concerning a specific Reddit employee, as well as provide you with context into actions that we took to prevent doxxing and harassment.

As of today, the employee in question is no longer employed by Reddit. We built a relationship with her first as a mod and then through her contractor work on RPAN. We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her. 

We’ve put significant effort into improving how we handle doxxing and harassment, and this employee was the subject of both. In this case, we over-indexed on protection, which had serious consequences in terms of enforcement actions. 

* On March 9th, we added extra protections for this employee, including actioning content that mentioned the employee’s name or shared personal information on third-party sites, which we reserve for serious cases of harassment and doxxing.
* On March 22nd, a news article about this employee was posted by a mod of r/ukpolitics. The article was removed and the submitter banned by the aforementioned rules. When contacted by the moderators of r/ukpolitics, we reviewed the actions, and reversed the ban on the moderator, and we informed the r/ukpolitics moderation team that we had restored the mod.
* We updated our rules to flag potential harassment for human review.

Debate and criticism have always been and always will be central to conversation on Reddit—including discussion about public figures and Reddit itself—as long as they are not used as vehicles for harassment. Mentioning a public figure’s name should not get you banned.

We care deeply for Reddit and appreciate that you do too. We understand the anger and confusion about these issues and their bigger implications. The employee is no longer with Reddit, and we’ll be evolving a number of relevant internal policies.

Today we’re testing a new way to discuss political ads (and announcements),spez,17316,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/ipitt0/today_were_testing_a_new_way_to_discuss_political/,2,"In case you missed [the](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/ikxsst/this_reddit_billboard_advertisement_for_their/) [billboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ilhck2/saw_one_in_the_wild_make_sure_to_vote_illinois/), [blog posts](https://redditblog.com/2020/09/01/its-national-poll-worker-recruitment-day-become-a-poll-worker-this-election-and-help-power-the-polls-in-your-community/), and [AMAs](https://redditblog.com/2020/08/25/voting-in-america/), we’re doing our best to encourage people on and off Reddit to vote this year. Along with our [Up the Vote campaign](https://redditblog.com/2020/07/29/up-the-vote-reddits-irl-2020-voting-campaign/) and [ongoing security and safety work](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/) to guard against shenanigans, we’ve also been evolving how we handle another important aspect of the election process: **political ads**.

## First, some background

Political ads have been a relatively quiet part of Reddit for many years. Last year, in thinking through what the right balance was between unfettered political ads and prohibiting them altogether for 2020 (both approaches that other platforms have taken), we decided on [a policy we felt was the best approach for Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/g0s6tn/changes_to_reddits_political_ads_policy/): no misinformation, human review of the ads and where they link, a subreddit listing all political ads ([r/RedditPoliticalAds](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditPoliticalAds/)), and a requirement to keep comments on for 24 hours.

Since debuting this policy earlier this year, the last condition (requiring comments to remain on) has enabled redditors to discuss political ads—providing more context in the comments and even offering counterarguments—but so far it’s only been lightly used. As we get closer to November, however, the prominence of and discussion around political ads will increase, and, with it, the need for a clear moderation system for these comments.

## The problem we’re addressing

As I mentioned [a couple months back](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/fwdxoty/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3&depth=2), unmoderated spaces on Reddit are an area we want to improve, from Modmail to PM’s, and political ads pose a unique challenge.

If the OP of a political ad (i.e., a campaign) moderates the comments, it’s problematic: they might remove dissenting perspectives. And if we (the admins) moderate the comments of a political ad, it’s even more problematic, putting us in the position of either moderating too much or too little, with inevitable accusations of bias either way.

The problem, we realized, is similar to what we see in r/announcements: lots of people commenting on a highly visible post outside the context of a community. It’s fair to say that r/announcements isn’t really a community; it lacks the culture, cohesion, and moderation that benefit most other subreddits, and as a result, the quality of conversation has deteriorated as the audience has grown.

Ultimately, conversations really only happen in the context of a community, and neither r/announcements nor political ads with comments on provide this. We believe we can foster better discussion on both with a different approach.

## What we’re testing today

Instead of having the usual free-for-all of comments on the r/announcements post itself, we are trying out a new experience today that encourages discussion of this post within other communities—an approach we hope works for political ads as well.

Below is a stickied comment with a link to submit this post to other communities on Reddit and a list of those discussion posts. The stickied comment will update automatically with new posts.

A few other details to note for this test:

* **The discussion posts are like any other post**, which means they can be voted on by users and removed by mods.
* **Communities that don’t want to participate don’t have to.** (If you’re a mod of a community where a user attempts to crosspost this, you will get a Modmail alerting you to this with [opt-out instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/).)
* **Individual community rules apply to these posts just as any other**, so read the rules before attempting to bring the discussion into a completely unrelated community.
* **Our stickied comment will link to discussions only from communities subject to our ads allow list.** Communities that have already opted not to appear in r/all won’t appear in the comment either, even if there is a discussion of this post there.
* **After today’s test, we will likely test this system with political ads.**

This test will be a success if there are a variety of posts and conversations about this post, even—and perhaps particularly—if they are critical.

## How we’re answering questions

r/announcements posts have an important difference from political ads: I treat them as AMAs and do my best to answer questions and respond to criticism (both of which I appreciate). With this approach, I expect doing so will be more difficult (at least this first time). However, the point of this test is not to make you hunt for our answers or for us to reply to fewer questions, and we don’t intend to use this approach for all our admin posts (e.g., in r/ModNews, r/changelog, r/ModSupport, and others, which are smaller subreddits that still work well).

For today, we’re going to make the first link of this post to r/ModNews and start by answering mods’ questions there. In a future announcement, we may ask a specific community if they would host us for the discussion that day (depending on what the announcement is) and set that as an official destination for discussion, like a regular AMA.

Additionally, I’ll do my best to find other places to respond, and we’ll maintain another comment below this post to list replies we’ve given outside of r/announcements so you can easily find our responses (which was a feature request from [our post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/g3r4xpm/) last week).

Ultimately, the goal of this test is to enable Reddit to do what Reddit does best: facilitate conversations (within the context of a community), provide commentary on political ads the way redditors already do on news and politics daily (sharing more information and calling bullshit in the comments when necessary), and extend the discussion well beyond the scope of the original post.

Thank you for participating. We hope this approach sets the stage for successful commentary not just today but down the road on political ads as well.

**Edit (9/28/20):** Update: After initial testing and a few small tweaks to the sorting and score display of the links in stickied comments like the one below, we’ll be using this discussion system on political ads moving forward. 

As I mentioned, our goal with this approach was to encourage these types of discussions to happen within the context of a community. While this feature is completely optional for communities (opt-out instructions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/)), we were pleased overall with the level of engagement that we saw from communities and users on this test post.

We’re still exploring how we’ll use this feature for r/announcements posts and how we can work with specific communities to have discussions about them.

Update to Our Content Policy,spez,21319,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/,38595,"[A few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/), we committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate. After talking extensively with mods, outside organizations, and our own teams, we’re updating our content policy today and enforcing it (with your help).

## First, a quick recap

Since our last post, here’s what we’ve been doing:

* **We brought on a** [**new Board member**](https://redditblog.com/2020/06/10/reddit-welcomes-michael-seibel-to-board-of-directors/).
* **We held policy calls with mods**—both from established Mod Councils and from communities disproportionately targeted with hate—and discussed areas where we can do better to action bad actors, clarify our policies, make mods' lives easier, and concretely reduce hate.
   * You can find [detailed notes from our All-Council mod call here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hi3nkr/the_mod_conversations_that_went_into_todays), including specific product work we discussed.
* **We developed our enforcement plan**, including both our immediate actions (e.g., today’s bans) and long-term investments (tackling the most critical work discussed in our mod calls, sustainably enforcing the new policies, and advancing Reddit’s community governance).

From our conversations with mods and outside experts, it’s clear that while we’ve gotten better in some areas—like actioning violations at the community level, [scaling enforcement efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/hbiuas/reddit_security_report_june_18_2020/), measurably reducing hateful experiences like harassment [year over year](https://www.adl.org/online-hate-2020#results)—we still have a long way to go to address the gaps in our policies and enforcement to date.

These include addressing questions our policies have left unanswered (like whether hate speech is allowed or even protected on Reddit), aspects of our product and mod tools that are still too easy for individual bad actors to abuse (inboxes, chats, modmail), and areas where we can do better to partner with our mods and communities who want to combat the same hateful conduct we do.

Ultimately, it’s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. In the near term, this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.

## New Policy

This is the [new content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). Here’s what’s different:

* It starts with a statement of our vision for Reddit and our communities, including the basic expectations we have for all communities and users.
* **Rule 1** explicitly states that communities and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.
   * There is an expanded definition of what constitutes a violation of this rule, along with specific examples, in our [Help Center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).
* **Rule 2** ties together our previous rules on prohibited behavior with an ask to abide by community rules and post with authentic, personal interest.
   * Debate and creativity are welcome, but spam and malicious attempts to interfere with other communities are not.
* The other rules are the same in spirit but have been rewritten for clarity and inclusiveness.

Alongside the change to the content policy, we are initially banning about 2000 subreddits, the vast majority of which are inactive. Of these communities, about [200](https://www.redditstatic.com/banned-subreddits-june-2020.txt) have more than 10 daily users. Both r/The_Donald and r/ChapoTrapHouse were included.

All communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so, despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1), antagonized us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8), and its mods have refused to meet our most basic expectations. Until now, we’ve worked in good faith to help them preserve the community as a space for its users—through warnings, mod changes, quarantining, and more.

Though smaller, r/ChapoTrapHouse was banned for similar reasons: They consistently host rule-breaking content and their mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.

To be clear, views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit—but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith, without exception.

## Our commitment

Our policies will never be perfect, with new edge cases that inevitably lead us to evolve them in the future. And as users, you will always have more context, community vernacular, and cultural values to inform the standards set within your communities than we as site admins or any AI ever could.

But just as our content moderation cannot scale effectively without your support, you need more support from us as well, and we admit we have fallen short towards this end. We are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors, abusive behaviors, and toxic communities that undermine our mission and get in the way of the creativity, discussions, and communities that bring us all to Reddit in the first place. We hope that our progress towards this commitment, with today’s update and those to come, makes Reddit a place you enjoy and are proud to be a part of for many years to come.

Edit: After digesting feedback, we made a clarifying change to our help center article for [Promoting Hate Based on Identity or Vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).",1593450006.0,Text
"Upcoming changes to our content policy, our board, and where we’re going from here",spez,40927,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/,40768,"**TL;DR: We’re working with mods to change our content policy to explicitly address hate.** u/kn0thing **has resigned from our board to fill his seat with a Black candidate, a request we will honor. I want to take responsibility for the history of our policies over the years that got us here, and we still have work to do.**

After watching people across the country mourn and demand an end to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people, I wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it, a duty to speak out.

Earlier this week, I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, “How can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?”

These questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy. 

Over the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities—across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could’ve imagined when we first created subreddits—and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.

However, as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:

* Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. 
* Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. 
* Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.

We are already working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it’s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.

We will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn’t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.

And just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he’s done for us over the years.

At the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.

In the early days of Reddit, 2005–2006, our idealistic “policy” was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our “policy.” 

I left Reddit from 2010–2015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit’s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). 

When I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what’s acceptable on Reddit and what’s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were “making Reddit worse” but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. 

While we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity—and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules, but also isn’t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.

This inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, “Breaking Reddit” was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.

The majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. 

Despite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.

I will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.

Thanks,

Forging A Return to Productive Conversation: An Open Letter to Reddit,Funny_Sentinel,1193,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/14jmh7e/forging_a_return_to_productive_conversation_an/,1,"To All Whom It May Concern:

For fifteen years, /r/Funny has been one of Reddit’s most-popular communities. That time hasn’t been without its difficulties, but for the most part, we’ve all gotten along (with each other and with administrators). Members of our team fondly remember Moderator Roadshows, visits to Reddit’s headquarters, Reddit Secret Santa, April Fools’ Day events, regional meetups, and many more uplifting moments. We’ve watched this platform grow by leaps and bounds, and although we haven’t been completely happy about every change that we’ve witnessed, we’ve always done our best to work with Reddit at finding ways to adapt, compromise, and move forward. 

This process has occasionally been preceded by some exceptionally public debate, however.

On June 12th, 2023, /r/Funny joined thousands of other subreddits in protesting the planned changes to Reddit’s API; changes which – despite being immediately evident to only a minority of Redditors – threatened to worsen the site for everyone. By June 16th, 2023, that demonstration had evolved to represent a wider (and growing) array of concerns, many of which arose in response to [Reddit’s statements to journalists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/16/reddit-ceo-blackout-moderators-steve-huffman/). Today (June 26th, 2023), we are hopeful that users and administrators alike can make a return to the productive dialogue that has served us in the past. 

We acknowledge that Reddit has placed itself in a situation that makes adjusting its current API roadmap impossible. 

However, we have the following requests:

- Commit to exploring ways by which third-party applications can make an affordable return.
- Commit to providing moderation tools and [accessibility options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/) (on Old Reddit, New Reddit, and mobile platforms) which match or exceed the functionality and utility of third-party applications.
- Commit to prioritizing a significant reduction in spam, misinformation, bigotry, and illegal content on Reddit.
- Guarantee that any future developments which may impact moderators, contributors, or stakeholders will be announced no less than one fiscal quarter before they are scheduled to go into effect.
- Work together with longstanding moderators to establish a reasonable roadmap and deadline for accomplishing all of the above.
- Affirm that efforts meant to keep Reddit accountable to its commitments and deadlines will hereafter not be met with insults, threats, removals, or hostility.
- Publicly affirm all of the above by way of updating Reddit’s User Agreement and Reddit’s Moderator Code of Conduct to include reasonable expectations and requirements for administrators’ behavior. 
- Implement and fill a senior-level role (with decision-making and policy-shaping power) of ""Moderator Advocate"" at Reddit, with a required qualification for the position being robust experience as a volunteer Reddit moderator.

Reddit is unique amongst social-media sites in that its lifeblood – its multitude of moderators and contributors – consists entirely of volunteers. We populate and curate the platform’s many communities, thereby providing a welcoming and engaging environment for all of its visitors. We receive little in the way of thanks for these efforts, but we frequently endure abuse, threats, attacks, and exposure to truly reprehensible media. Historically, we have trusted that Reddit’s administrators have the best interests of the platform and its users (be they moderators, contributors, participants, or lurkers) at heart; that while Reddit may be a for-profit company, it nonetheless recognizes and appreciates the value that Redditors provide. 

That trust has been all but entirely eroded… but we hope that together, we can begin to rebuild it.

In simplest terms, Reddit, we implore you: **Remember the human**. 

We look forward to your response by Thursday, June 29th, 2023.

Announcing a ban on AI generated videos (with a few exceptions),ianjm,1853,https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1cg9nud/announcing_a_ban_on_ai_generated_videos_with_a/,279,"Howdy r/videos,

We all know the robots are coming for our jobs and our lives - but now they're coming for our subreddit too.

Multiple videos that have weird scripts that sound like they've come straight out of a kindergartener's thesaurus now regularly show up in the new queue, and all of them voiced by those same slightly off-putting set of cheap or free AI voice clones that everyone is using.

Not only are they annoying, but 99 times out of 100 they are also just bad videos, and, unfortunately, there is a very large overlap between the sorts of people who want to use AI to make their Youtube video, and the sorts of people who'll pay for a botnet to upvote it on Reddit.

So, starting today, we're proposing a full ban on low effort AI generated content. As mods we often already remove these, but we don't catch them all. You will soon be able to report both posts and comments as 'AI' and we'll remove them.

There will, however, be a few small exceptions. **All of which must have the new AI flair applied** (_which we will sort out in the coming couple days - a little flair housekeeping to do first_).

Some examples:

- Use of the tech in collaboration with a strong human element, e.g. creating a cartoon where AI has been used to help generate the video element based on a human-written script. 
- Demonstrations the progress of the technology (e.g. [Introducing Sora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK6y8DAPN_0))
- Satire that is actually funny (e.g. [satirical adverts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSewd6Iaj6I), deepfakes that are obvious and amusing) - though remember Rule 2, NO POLITICS
- Artistic pieces that aren't just crummy visualisers 

All of this will be up to the r/videos denizens, if we see an AI piece in the new queue that meets the above exceptions and is getting strongly upvoted, so long as is properly identified, it can stay.

The vast majority of AI videos we've seen so far though, do not.

Thanks, we hope this makes sense.

**Feedback welcome! If you have any suggestions about this policy, or just want to call the mods a bunch of assholes, now is your chance.**",1714422897.0,Text

""July the 14th, 1861

Washington D.C.

My very dear Sarah:

The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days—perhaps tomorrow. Lest I should not be able to write you again, I feel impelled to write lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more.

Our movement may be one of a few days duration and full of pleasure—and it may be one of severe conflict and death to me. Not my will, but thine O God, be done. If it is necessary that I should fall on the battlefield for my country, I am ready. I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in, the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how strongly American Civilization now leans upon the triumph of the Government, and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the Revolution. And I am willing—perfectly willing—to lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this Government, and to pay that debt.


But, my dear wife, when I know that with my own joys I lay down nearly all of yours, and replace them in this life with cares and sorrows—when, after having eaten for long years the bitter fruit of orphanage myself, I must offer it as their only sustenance to my dear little children—is it weak or dishonorable, while the banner of my purpose floats calmly and proudly in the breeze, that my unbounded love for you, my darling wife and children, should struggle in fierce, though useless, contest with my love of country.

Sarah, my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me to you with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break; and yet my love of Country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on with all these chains to the battlefield.

The memories of the blissful moments I have spent with you come creeping over me, and I feel most gratified to God and to you that I have enjoyed them so long. And hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years, when God willing, we might still have lived and loved together and seen our sons grow up to honorable manhood around us. I have, I know, but few and small claims upon Divine Providence, but something whispers to me—perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar—that I shall return to my loved ones unharmed. If I do not, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, and when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name.

Forgive my many faults, and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless and foolish I have often been! How gladly would I wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness, and struggle with all the misfortune of this world, to shield you and my children from harm. But I cannot. I must watch you from the spirit land and hover near you, while you buffet the storms with your precious little freight, and wait with sad patience till we meet to part no more.

But, O Sarah! If the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you; in the brightest day and in the darkest night—amidst your happiest scenes and gloomiest hours—always, always; and if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shall be my breath; or the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by.

Sarah, do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for thee, for we shall meet again.
As for my little boys, they will grow as I have done, and never know a father's love and care. Little Willie is too young to remember me long, and my blue-eyed Edgar will keep my frolics with him among the dimmest memories of his childhood. Sarah, I have unlimited confidence in your maternal care and your development of their characters. Tell my two mothers his and hers I call God's blessing upon them. O Sarah, I wait for you there! Come to me, and lead thither my children.

Announcing a ban on AI generated videos (with a few exceptions),ianjm,1848,https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1cg9nud/announcing_a_ban_on_ai_generated_videos_with_a/,279,"Howdy r/videos,

We all know the robots are coming for our jobs and our lives - but now they're coming for our subreddit too.

Multiple videos that have weird scripts that sound like they've come straight out of a kindergartener's thesaurus now regularly show up in the new queue, and all of them voiced by those same slightly off-putting set of cheap or free AI voice clones that everyone is using.

Not only are they annoying, but 99 times out of 100 they are also just bad videos, and, unfortunately, there is a very large overlap between the sorts of people who want to use AI to make their Youtube video, and the sorts of people who'll pay for a botnet to upvote it on Reddit.

So, starting today, we're proposing a full ban on low effort AI generated content. As mods we often already remove these, but we don't catch them all. You will soon be able to report both posts and comments as 'AI' and we'll remove them.

There will, however, be a few small exceptions. **All of which must have the new AI flair applied** (_which we will sort out in the coming couple days - a little flair housekeeping to do first_).

Some examples:

- Use of the tech in collaboration with a strong human element, e.g. creating a cartoon where AI has been used to help generate the video element based on a human-written script. 
- Demonstrations the progress of the technology (e.g. [Introducing Sora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK6y8DAPN_0))
- Satire that is actually funny (e.g. [satirical adverts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSewd6Iaj6I), deepfakes that are obvious and amusing) - though remember Rule 2, NO POLITICS
- Artistic pieces that aren't just crummy visualisers 

All of this will be up to the r/videos denizens, if we see an AI piece in the new queue that meets the above exceptions and is getting strongly upvoted, so long as is properly identified, it can stay.

The vast majority of AI videos we've seen so far though, do not.

Thanks, we hope this makes sense.

**Feedback welcome! If you have any suggestions about this policy, or just want to call the mods a bunch of assholes, now is your chance.**",1714422897.0,Text

Washington D.C.

My very dear Sarah:

The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days—perhaps tomorrow. Lest I should not be able to write you again, I feel impelled to write lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more.

Our movement may be one of a few days duration and full of pleasure—and it may be one of severe conflict and death to me. Not my will, but thine O God, be done. If it is necessary that I should fall on the battlefield for my country, I am ready. I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in, the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how strongly American Civilization now leans upon the triumph of the Government, and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the Revolution. And I am willing—perfectly willing—to lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this Government, and to pay that debt.


But, my dear wife, when I know that with my own joys I lay down nearly all of yours, and replace them in this life with cares and sorrows—when, after having eaten for long years the bitter fruit of orphanage myself, I must offer it as their only sustenance to my dear little children—is it weak or dishonorable, while the banner of my purpose floats calmly and proudly in the breeze, that my unbounded love for you, my darling wife and children, should struggle in fierce, though useless, contest with my love of country.

Sarah, my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me to you with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break; and yet my love of Country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on with all these chains to the battlefield.

The memories of the blissful moments I have spent with you come creeping over me, and I feel most gratified to God and to you that I have enjoyed them so long. And hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years, when God willing, we might still have lived and loved together and seen our sons grow up to honorable manhood around us. I have, I know, but few and small claims upon Divine Providence, but something whispers to me—perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar—that I shall return to my loved ones unharmed. If I do not, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, and when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name.

Forgive my many faults, and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless and foolish I have often been! How gladly would I wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness, and struggle with all the misfortune of this world, to shield you and my children from harm. But I cannot. I must watch you from the spirit land and hover near you, while you buffet the storms with your precious little freight, and wait with sad patience till we meet to part no more.

But, O Sarah! If the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you; in the brightest day and in the darkest night—amidst your happiest scenes and gloomiest hours—always, always; and if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shall be my breath; or the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by.

Sarah, do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for thee, for we shall meet again.
As for my little boys, they will grow as I have done, and never know a father's love and care. Little Willie is too young to remember me long, and my blue-eyed Edgar will keep my frolics with him among the dimmest memories of his childhood. Sarah, I have unlimited confidence in your maternal care and your development of their characters. Tell my two mothers his and hers I call God's blessing upon them. O Sarah, I wait for you there! Come to me, and lead thither my children.

"Debate, dissent, and protest on Reddit",spez,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/pbmy5y/debate_dissent_and_protest_on_reddit/,1,"Hey everyone–

The pandemic has been extremely hard on many of us. We believe the best way forward for everyone is to [get vaccinated](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) and continue to follow [CDC guidance on masking](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html). Throughout the pandemic, we have also provided COVID-related resources to support our volunteer moderators, users, and communities, including a dedicated AMA series connecting users with [authoritative experts on coronavirus](https://redditblog.com/2020/03/02/expert-conversation-on-coronavirus/) and [vaccines](https://redditblog.com/2021/01/28/introducing-a-new-reddit-ama-series-everything-you-want-to-know-about-covid-19-vaccines/), as well as deploying homepage and search page banners directing users to the CDC and r/Coronavirus.

We appreciate that not everyone agrees with the current approach to getting us all through the pandemic, and some are still wary of vaccinations. Dissent is a part of Reddit and the foundation of democracy. Reddit is a place for open and authentic discussion and debate. This includes conversations that question or disagree with popular consensus. This includes conversations that criticize those that disagree with the majority opinion. This includes protests that criticize or object to our decisions on which communities to ban from the platform.

While we appreciate the sentiment of those demanding that we ban more communities that challenge consensus views on the pandemic, we continue to believe in the good of our communities and hope that we collectively approach the challenges of the pandemic with empathy, compassion, and a willingness to understand what others are going through, even when their viewpoint on the pandemic is different from yours. 

When it comes to COVID-19 specifically, what we know and what are the current best practices from authoritative sources, like the CDC, evolve continuously with new learnings. Given the rapid state of change, we believe it is best to enable communities to engage in debate and dissent, and for us to link to the CDC wherever appropriate. While we believe the CDC is the best and most up to date source of information regarding COVID-19, disagreeing with them is not against our policies.

However, manipulating or cheating Reddit to amplify any particular viewpoint is against our policies, and we will continue to action communities that do so or that violate any of our other rules, including those dedicated to fraud (e.g. fake vaccine cards) or encouraging harm (e.g. consuming bleach); and we will continue to use our quarantine tool to link to authoritative sources and warn people they may encounter unsound advice. We humbly ask and encourage everyone to report content that may violate our policies.

**We didn’t make this decision lightly.** 

We made the difficult decision to shut down Reddit Gifts and put more focus on enhancing the [user experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/mqcpcg/you_want_a_better_reddit_search_ok_were_on_it/) on Reddit - this includes [investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/ldgmfc/diamond_hands_on_the_data/) in the [foundation](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/nudfv1/the_rollout_of_reputation_service/) [of our](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/lb2p7a/a_new_video_player_updated_email_designs_mobile/) [platform](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/neknjg/evolving_beyond_100_billion_recommendations_a_day/) and [moderator tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/nk7p7j/new_updates_to_help_moderators_your_monthly/), making it more [accessible](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/mzse3p/control_over_your_followers_spring_avatar_gear_a/) for people around the world and evolving how people [engage](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/nmhmj0/q1_safety_security_report_may_27_2021/) with one another.

We’re hopeful that spirit will continue in the future. 

**What this means for future exchanges in 2021**

In preparation for retiring Reddit Gifts after the final exchange at the end of 2021, we will be taking the following actions: 

* In order to limit incomplete exchanges, we have disabled the creation of any new Reddit Gifts accounts. If you have an existing Reddit Gifts account, we would love it if you would participate with us in these final exchanges. 
* Any incomplete exchanges will result in a ban from the remaining Reddit Gifts exchanges.
* This morning, we turned off the ability to buy [Elves](https://www.redditgifts.com/Elves/). If you purchased an Elves membership and have remaining months after the 2021 Secret Santa Exchange, we will email you about your refund options then. If you have specific concerns about your Elves membership, please reach out to Reddit Gifts [support](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000825092). 

These changes have been put in place to ensure that these last exchanges are enjoyable for the legacy Reddit Gifts users. We want to celebrate the end of Reddit Gifts with the community that we’ve built so far. 

Countless acts of love, heroism, compassion, support, growth and hilarity happened through Reddit Gifts, and those memories will live on in the hearts of our community. We’re working on ways to capture these moments and look forward to seeing how the spirit and connection of exchanging gifts with strangers will live on.

As of today, the employee in question is no longer employed by Reddit. We built a relationship with her first as a mod and then through her contractor work on RPAN. We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her. 

We’ve put significant effort into improving how we handle doxxing and harassment, and this employee was the subject of both. In this case, we over-indexed on protection, which had serious consequences in terms of enforcement actions. 

* On March 9th, we added extra protections for this employee, including actioning content that mentioned the employee’s name or shared personal information on third-party sites, which we reserve for serious cases of harassment and doxxing.
* On March 22nd, a news article about this employee was posted by a mod of r/ukpolitics. The article was removed and the submitter banned by the aforementioned rules. When contacted by the moderators of r/ukpolitics, we reviewed the actions, and reversed the ban on the moderator, and we informed the r/ukpolitics moderation team that we had restored the mod.
* We updated our rules to flag potential harassment for human review.

Debate and criticism have always been and always will be central to conversation on Reddit—including discussion about public figures and Reddit itself—as long as they are not used as vehicles for harassment. Mentioning a public figure’s name should not get you banned.

We care deeply for Reddit and appreciate that you do too. We understand the anger and confusion about these issues and their bigger implications. The employee is no longer with Reddit, and we’ll be evolving a number of relevant internal policies.

Today we’re testing a new way to discuss political ads (and announcements),spez,17314,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/ipitt0/today_were_testing_a_new_way_to_discuss_political/,2,"In case you missed [the](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/ikxsst/this_reddit_billboard_advertisement_for_their/) [billboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ilhck2/saw_one_in_the_wild_make_sure_to_vote_illinois/), [blog posts](https://redditblog.com/2020/09/01/its-national-poll-worker-recruitment-day-become-a-poll-worker-this-election-and-help-power-the-polls-in-your-community/), and [AMAs](https://redditblog.com/2020/08/25/voting-in-america/), we’re doing our best to encourage people on and off Reddit to vote this year. Along with our [Up the Vote campaign](https://redditblog.com/2020/07/29/up-the-vote-reddits-irl-2020-voting-campaign/) and [ongoing security and safety work](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/) to guard against shenanigans, we’ve also been evolving how we handle another important aspect of the election process: **political ads**.

## First, some background

Political ads have been a relatively quiet part of Reddit for many years. Last year, in thinking through what the right balance was between unfettered political ads and prohibiting them altogether for 2020 (both approaches that other platforms have taken), we decided on [a policy we felt was the best approach for Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/g0s6tn/changes_to_reddits_political_ads_policy/): no misinformation, human review of the ads and where they link, a subreddit listing all political ads ([r/RedditPoliticalAds](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditPoliticalAds/)), and a requirement to keep comments on for 24 hours.

Since debuting this policy earlier this year, the last condition (requiring comments to remain on) has enabled redditors to discuss political ads—providing more context in the comments and even offering counterarguments—but so far it’s only been lightly used. As we get closer to November, however, the prominence of and discussion around political ads will increase, and, with it, the need for a clear moderation system for these comments.

## The problem we’re addressing

As I mentioned [a couple months back](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/fwdxoty/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3&depth=2), unmoderated spaces on Reddit are an area we want to improve, from Modmail to PM’s, and political ads pose a unique challenge.

If the OP of a political ad (i.e., a campaign) moderates the comments, it’s problematic: they might remove dissenting perspectives. And if we (the admins) moderate the comments of a political ad, it’s even more problematic, putting us in the position of either moderating too much or too little, with inevitable accusations of bias either way.

The problem, we realized, is similar to what we see in r/announcements: lots of people commenting on a highly visible post outside the context of a community. It’s fair to say that r/announcements isn’t really a community; it lacks the culture, cohesion, and moderation that benefit most other subreddits, and as a result, the quality of conversation has deteriorated as the audience has grown.

Ultimately, conversations really only happen in the context of a community, and neither r/announcements nor political ads with comments on provide this. We believe we can foster better discussion on both with a different approach.

## What we’re testing today

Instead of having the usual free-for-all of comments on the r/announcements post itself, we are trying out a new experience today that encourages discussion of this post within other communities—an approach we hope works for political ads as well.

Below is a stickied comment with a link to submit this post to other communities on Reddit and a list of those discussion posts. The stickied comment will update automatically with new posts.

A few other details to note for this test:

* **The discussion posts are like any other post**, which means they can be voted on by users and removed by mods.
* **Communities that don’t want to participate don’t have to.** (If you’re a mod of a community where a user attempts to crosspost this, you will get a Modmail alerting you to this with [opt-out instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/).)
* **Individual community rules apply to these posts just as any other**, so read the rules before attempting to bring the discussion into a completely unrelated community.
* **Our stickied comment will link to discussions only from communities subject to our ads allow list.** Communities that have already opted not to appear in r/all won’t appear in the comment either, even if there is a discussion of this post there.
* **After today’s test, we will likely test this system with political ads.**

This test will be a success if there are a variety of posts and conversations about this post, even—and perhaps particularly—if they are critical.

## How we’re answering questions

r/announcements posts have an important difference from political ads: I treat them as AMAs and do my best to answer questions and respond to criticism (both of which I appreciate). With this approach, I expect doing so will be more difficult (at least this first time). However, the point of this test is not to make you hunt for our answers or for us to reply to fewer questions, and we don’t intend to use this approach for all our admin posts (e.g., in r/ModNews, r/changelog, r/ModSupport, and others, which are smaller subreddits that still work well).

For today, we’re going to make the first link of this post to r/ModNews and start by answering mods’ questions there. In a future announcement, we may ask a specific community if they would host us for the discussion that day (depending on what the announcement is) and set that as an official destination for discussion, like a regular AMA.

Additionally, I’ll do my best to find other places to respond, and we’ll maintain another comment below this post to list replies we’ve given outside of r/announcements so you can easily find our responses (which was a feature request from [our post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/g3r4xpm/) last week).

Ultimately, the goal of this test is to enable Reddit to do what Reddit does best: facilitate conversations (within the context of a community), provide commentary on political ads the way redditors already do on news and politics daily (sharing more information and calling bullshit in the comments when necessary), and extend the discussion well beyond the scope of the original post.

Thank you for participating. We hope this approach sets the stage for successful commentary not just today but down the road on political ads as well.

**Edit (9/28/20):** Update: After initial testing and a few small tweaks to the sorting and score display of the links in stickied comments like the one below, we’ll be using this discussion system on political ads moving forward. 

As I mentioned, our goal with this approach was to encourage these types of discussions to happen within the context of a community. While this feature is completely optional for communities (opt-out instructions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/)), we were pleased overall with the level of engagement that we saw from communities and users on this test post.

We’re still exploring how we’ll use this feature for r/announcements posts and how we can work with specific communities to have discussions about them. In the meantime, you can see our updated political ads policy on our [Advertising Policy Help Page](https://advertising.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-advertising-policy/reddit-advertising-policy-overview).",1599667576.0,Text

Update to Our Content Policy,spez,21317,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/,38595,"[A few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/), we committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate. After talking extensively with mods, outside organizations, and our own teams, we’re updating our content policy today and enforcing it (with your help).

## First, a quick recap

Since our last post, here’s what we’ve been doing:

* **We brought on a** [**new Board member**](https://redditblog.com/2020/06/10/reddit-welcomes-michael-seibel-to-board-of-directors/).
* **We held policy calls with mods**—both from established Mod Councils and from communities disproportionately targeted with hate—and discussed areas where we can do better to action bad actors, clarify our policies, make mods' lives easier, and concretely reduce hate.
   * You can find [detailed notes from our All-Council mod call here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hi3nkr/the_mod_conversations_that_went_into_todays), including specific product work we discussed.
* **We developed our enforcement plan**, including both our immediate actions (e.g., today’s bans) and long-term investments (tackling the most critical work discussed in our mod calls, sustainably enforcing the new policies, and advancing Reddit’s community governance).

From our conversations with mods and outside experts, it’s clear that while we’ve gotten better in some areas—like actioning violations at the community level, [scaling enforcement efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/hbiuas/reddit_security_report_june_18_2020/), measurably reducing hateful experiences like harassment [year over year](https://www.adl.org/online-hate-2020#results)—we still have a long way to go to address the gaps in our policies and enforcement to date.

These include addressing questions our policies have left unanswered (like whether hate speech is allowed or even protected on Reddit), aspects of our product and mod tools that are still too easy for individual bad actors to abuse (inboxes, chats, modmail), and areas where we can do better to partner with our mods and communities who want to combat the same hateful conduct we do.

Ultimately, it’s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. In the near term, this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.

## New Policy

This is the [new content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). Here’s what’s different:

* It starts with a statement of our vision for Reddit and our communities, including the basic expectations we have for all communities and users.
* **Rule 1** explicitly states that communities and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.
   * There is an expanded definition of what constitutes a violation of this rule, along with specific examples, in our [Help Center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).
* **Rule 2** ties together our previous rules on prohibited behavior with an ask to abide by community rules and post with authentic, personal interest.
   * Debate and creativity are welcome, but spam and malicious attempts to interfere with other communities are not.
* The other rules are the same in spirit but have been rewritten for clarity and inclusiveness.

Alongside the change to the content policy, we are initially banning about 2000 subreddits, the vast majority of which are inactive. Of these communities, about [200](https://www.redditstatic.com/banned-subreddits-june-2020.txt) have more than 10 daily users. Both r/The_Donald and r/ChapoTrapHouse were included.

All communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so, despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1), antagonized us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8), and its mods have refused to meet our most basic expectations. Until now, we’ve worked in good faith to help them preserve the community as a space for its users—through warnings, mod changes, quarantining, and more.

Though smaller, r/ChapoTrapHouse was banned for similar reasons: They consistently host rule-breaking content and their mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.

To be clear, views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit—but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith, without exception.

## Our commitment

Our policies will never be perfect, with new edge cases that inevitably lead us to evolve them in the future. And as users, you will always have more context, community vernacular, and cultural values to inform the standards set within your communities than we as site admins or any AI ever could.

But just as our content moderation cannot scale effectively without your support, you need more support from us as well, and we admit we have fallen short towards this end. We are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors, abusive behaviors, and toxic communities that undermine our mission and get in the way of the creativity, discussions, and communities that bring us all to Reddit in the first place. We hope that our progress towards this commitment, with today’s update and those to come, makes Reddit a place you enjoy and are proud to be a part of for many years to come.

Edit: After digesting feedback, we made a clarifying change to our help center article for [Promoting Hate Based on Identity or Vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).",1593450006.0,Text
"Upcoming changes to our content policy, our board, and where we’re going from here",spez,40929,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/,40768,"**TL;DR: We’re working with mods to change our content policy to explicitly address hate.** u/kn0thing **has resigned from our board to fill his seat with a Black candidate, a request we will honor. I want to take responsibility for the history of our policies over the years that got us here, and we still have work to do.**

After watching people across the country mourn and demand an end to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people, I wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it, a duty to speak out.

Earlier this week, I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, “How can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?”

These questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy. 

Over the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities—across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could’ve imagined when we first created subreddits—and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.

However, as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:

* Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. 
* Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. 
* Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.

We are already working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it’s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.

We will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn’t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.

And just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he’s done for us over the years.

At the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.

In the early days of Reddit, 2005–2006, our idealistic “policy” was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our “policy.” 

I left Reddit from 2010–2015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit’s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). 

When I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what’s acceptable on Reddit and what’s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were “making Reddit worse” but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. 

While we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity—and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules, but also isn’t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.

This inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, “Breaking Reddit” was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.

The majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. 

Despite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.

I will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.

Thanks,

Godzilla 2014 deserved better sequels.,maruhadapurpurine,262,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1d5yorj/godzilla_2014_deserved_better_sequels/,121,"I finally got around to watching those monsterverse movies this week and boy... how did they manage to peak right at the start?

The 2014 movie is so vastly above the sequels in tone and quality that it's hard to believe they belong in the same continuity. Godzilla 2014 is as grounded as a story about a giant lizard monster fighting other giant monsters can be. The human element is much simpler and easier to empathize with. The effects feel years ahead of what came after too. The destruction caused by the monsters fighting feel appropriately bleak while also being super awesome to watch.

I don't think any moment in the sequels ever got me nearly as hyped as when Godzilla shoots his atomic breath down the MUTO's throat. Hell even his first full appearance at Hawaii got me more hyped than anything in the sequels to be honest.

Yeah, I will be the first to agree that for a Godzilla movie there isn't nearly enough Godzilla in it, but maybe they were on to something by keeping his presence so brief until later. The sequels have monsters galore and they're no better for it.

The whole time watching King of the Monsters I was only ever mildly amused by all of it. Gidorah just looked goofy as fuck most of the time because it clashes so much with the semi realism that Godzilla was designed with. The human plot is absolutely awful and should have been cut down by a lot.

Godzilla vs Kong is alright... Sure the fight scenes are cool, but once again the human characters detract way more than add anything to it, especially the podcast guy and the kids. Why are they even here? The stranger things girl's story was over already, why is she back?

And the sci-fi shit was already too much last movie, in this one they just jump the shark completely. It's like they couldn't figure out how to keep the story going so the movies just got progressively dumber with each entry, like a kid mashing toys together. Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy a movie like that, but when you compare it with the 2014 movie it is just so disappointing to see such a major departure in direction. It's like they lost the plot.

Kong Skull Island was fun though. Nice twist to have Samual L Jackson as the villain. I would rank this one just below Godzilla 2014. Even if the tone between them is still completely different at least Skull Island managed to keep itself together by succeeding in the same areas that Godzilla did. Straightforward, centered plot, the human characters contribute to the story instead of detracting from it, great action scenes.

The only one left is Godzilla x Kong and I'm already not expecting anything aside some dumb but fun fight scenes, and just hoping the human characters are cut down to a minimum.

On a side note I also watched Shin Godzilla and will watch Godzilla Minus One as well. The take is so different you can't even really compare them. Shin Godzilla is much more of a political commentary on the japanese government than anything else. I guess that keeps the line much closer to the OG Godzilla movie.

Edit: I finished watching Minus One and GxK The New Empire so here are my brief thoughts.

Minus One: Obviously not related to the monsterverse but it pretty much nails the human element in a Godzilla movie. Even when you know where te story is going it still hits the emotional notes. Because of that I would say it is overall better than the 2014 version (though I would still say that 2014 has better hype moments. You just can't top that atomic breath straight down the MUTO's mouth.)

GxK: This movie is completely ridiculous in every way possible and it just cemented my thoughts on this. Regardless of what I think about the quality of the sequels, these movies absolutely shouldn't be in the same universe. The tone is too different, the world is simply not the same. There is no way you can watch GxK and then look at 2014 Godzilla and say they fit together. It just doesn't work. Again, I'm not against movies like this. They have an audience, and I can honestly say I had some fun watching it, but it should've been its own thing and not related to the 2014 movie, which in turn deserved a sequel much more in line with its tone and vision of the Godzilla universe.",1717281094.0,Text

Forging A Return to Productive Conversation: An Open Letter to Reddit,Funny_Sentinel,1197,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/14jmh7e/forging_a_return_to_productive_conversation_an/,1,"To All Whom It May Concern:

For fifteen years, /r/Funny has been one of Reddit’s most-popular communities. That time hasn’t been without its difficulties, but for the most part, we’ve all gotten along (with each other and with administrators). Members of our team fondly remember Moderator Roadshows, visits to Reddit’s headquarters, Reddit Secret Santa, April Fools’ Day events, regional meetups, and many more uplifting moments. We’ve watched this platform grow by leaps and bounds, and although we haven’t been completely happy about every change that we’ve witnessed, we’ve always done our best to work with Reddit at finding ways to adapt, compromise, and move forward. 

This process has occasionally been preceded by some exceptionally public debate, however.

On June 12th, 2023, /r/Funny joined thousands of other subreddits in protesting the planned changes to Reddit’s API; changes which – despite being immediately evident to only a minority of Redditors – threatened to worsen the site for everyone. By June 16th, 2023, that demonstration had evolved to represent a wider (and growing) array of concerns, many of which arose in response to [Reddit’s statements to journalists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/16/reddit-ceo-blackout-moderators-steve-huffman/). Today (June 26th, 2023), we are hopeful that users and administrators alike can make a return to the productive dialogue that has served us in the past. 

We acknowledge that Reddit has placed itself in a situation that makes adjusting its current API roadmap impossible. 

However, we have the following requests:

- Commit to providing moderation tools and [accessibility options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/) (on Old Reddit, New Reddit, and mobile platforms) which match or exceed the functionality and utility of third-party applications.
- Commit to prioritizing a significant reduction in spam, misinformation, bigotry, and illegal content on Reddit.
- Guarantee that any future developments which may impact moderators, contributors, or stakeholders will be announced no less than one fiscal quarter before they are scheduled to go into effect.
- Work together with longstanding moderators to establish a reasonable roadmap and deadline for accomplishing all of the above.
- Affirm that efforts meant to keep Reddit accountable to its commitments and deadlines will hereafter not be met with insults, threats, removals, or hostility.
- Publicly affirm all of the above by way of updating Reddit’s User Agreement and Reddit’s Moderator Code of Conduct to include reasonable expectations and requirements for administrators’ behavior. 
- Implement and fill a senior-level role (with decision-making and policy-shaping power) of ""Moderator Advocate"" at Reddit, with a required qualification for the position being robust experience as a volunteer Reddit moderator.

Reddit is unique amongst social-media sites in that its lifeblood – its multitude of moderators and contributors – consists entirely of volunteers. We populate and curate the platform’s many communities, thereby providing a welcoming and engaging environment for all of its visitors. We receive little in the way of thanks for these efforts, but we frequently endure abuse, threats, attacks, and exposure to truly reprehensible media. Historically, we have trusted that Reddit’s administrators have the best interests of the platform and its users (be they moderators, contributors, participants, or lurkers) at heart; that while Reddit may be a for-profit company, it nonetheless recognizes and appreciates the value that Redditors provide. 

That trust has been all but entirely eroded… but we hope that together, we can begin to rebuild it.

In simplest terms, Reddit, we implore you: **Remember the human**. 

We look forward to your response by Thursday, June 29th, 2023.

We all know the robots are coming for our jobs and our lives - but now they're coming for our subreddit too.

Multiple videos that have weird scripts that sound like they've come straight out of a kindergartener's thesaurus now regularly show up in the new queue, and all of them voiced by those same slightly off-putting set of cheap or free AI voice clones that everyone is using.

Not only are they annoying, but 99 times out of 100 they are also just bad videos, and, unfortunately, there is a very large overlap between the sorts of people who want to use AI to make their Youtube video, and the sorts of people who'll pay for a botnet to upvote it on Reddit.

So, starting today, we're proposing a full ban on low effort AI generated content. As mods we often already remove these, but we don't catch them all. You will soon be able to report both posts and comments as 'AI' and we'll remove them.

There will, however, be a few small exceptions. **All of which must have the new AI flair applied** (_which we will sort out in the coming couple days - a little flair housekeeping to do first_).

Some examples:

- Use of the tech in collaboration with a strong human element, e.g. creating a cartoon where AI has been used to help generate the video element based on a human-written script. 
- Demonstrations the progress of the technology (e.g. [Introducing Sora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK6y8DAPN_0))
- Satire that is actually funny (e.g. [satirical adverts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSewd6Iaj6I), deepfakes that are obvious and amusing) - though remember Rule 2, NO POLITICS
- Artistic pieces that aren't just crummy visualisers 

All of this will be up to the r/videos denizens, if we see an AI piece in the new queue that meets the above exceptions and is getting strongly upvoted, so long as is properly identified, it can stay.

The vast majority of AI videos we've seen so far though, do not.

Thanks, we hope this makes sense.

**Feedback welcome! If you have any suggestions about this policy, or just want to call the mods a bunch of assholes, now is your chance.**",1714422897.0,Text

""July the 14th, 1861

Washington D.C.

My very dear Sarah:

The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days—perhaps tomorrow. Lest I should not be able to write you again, I feel impelled to write lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more.

Our movement may be one of a few days duration and full of pleasure—and it may be one of severe conflict and death to me. Not my will, but thine O God, be done. If it is necessary that I should fall on the battlefield for my country, I am ready. I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in, the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how strongly American Civilization now leans upon the triumph of the Government, and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the Revolution. And I am willing—perfectly willing—to lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this Government, and to pay that debt.


But, my dear wife, when I know that with my own joys I lay down nearly all of yours, and replace them in this life with cares and sorrows—when, after having eaten for long years the bitter fruit of orphanage myself, I must offer it as their only sustenance to my dear little children—is it weak or dishonorable, while the banner of my purpose floats calmly and proudly in the breeze, that my unbounded love for you, my darling wife and children, should struggle in fierce, though useless, contest with my love of country.

Sarah, my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me to you with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break; and yet my love of Country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on with all these chains to the battlefield.

The memories of the blissful moments I have spent with you come creeping over me, and I feel most gratified to God and to you that I have enjoyed them so long. And hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years, when God willing, we might still have lived and loved together and seen our sons grow up to honorable manhood around us. I have, I know, but few and small claims upon Divine Providence, but something whispers to me—perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar—that I shall return to my loved ones unharmed. If I do not, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, and when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name.

Forgive my many faults, and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless and foolish I have often been! How gladly would I wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness, and struggle with all the misfortune of this world, to shield you and my children from harm. But I cannot. I must watch you from the spirit land and hover near you, while you buffet the storms with your precious little freight, and wait with sad patience till we meet to part no more.

But, O Sarah! If the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you; in the brightest day and in the darkest night—amidst your happiest scenes and gloomiest hours—always, always; and if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shall be my breath; or the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by.

Sarah, do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for thee, for we shall meet again.
As for my little boys, they will grow as I have done, and never know a father's love and care. Little Willie is too young to remember me long, and my blue-eyed Edgar will keep my frolics with him among the dimmest memories of his childhood. Sarah, I have unlimited confidence in your maternal care and your development of their characters. Tell my two mothers his and hers I call God's blessing upon them. O Sarah, I wait for you there! Come to me, and lead thither my children.

Forging A Return to Productive Conversation: An Open Letter to Reddit,Funny_Sentinel,1193,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/14jmh7e/forging_a_return_to_productive_conversation_an/,1,"To All Whom It May Concern:

For fifteen years, /r/Funny has been one of Reddit’s most-popular communities. That time hasn’t been without its difficulties, but for the most part, we’ve all gotten along (with each other and with administrators). Members of our team fondly remember Moderator Roadshows, visits to Reddit’s headquarters, Reddit Secret Santa, April Fools’ Day events, regional meetups, and many more uplifting moments. We’ve watched this platform grow by leaps and bounds, and although we haven’t been completely happy about every change that we’ve witnessed, we’ve always done our best to work with Reddit at finding ways to adapt, compromise, and move forward. 

This process has occasionally been preceded by some exceptionally public debate, however.

On June 12th, 2023, /r/Funny joined thousands of other subreddits in protesting the planned changes to Reddit’s API; changes which – despite being immediately evident to only a minority of Redditors – threatened to worsen the site for everyone. By June 16th, 2023, that demonstration had evolved to represent a wider (and growing) array of concerns, many of which arose in response to [Reddit’s statements to journalists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/16/reddit-ceo-blackout-moderators-steve-huffman/). Today (June 26th, 2023), we are hopeful that users and administrators alike can make a return to the productive dialogue that has served us in the past. 

We acknowledge that Reddit has placed itself in a situation that makes adjusting its current API roadmap impossible. 

However, we have the following requests:

- Commit to exploring ways by which third-party applications can make an affordable return.
- Commit to providing moderation tools and [accessibility options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/) (on Old Reddit, New Reddit, and mobile platforms) which match or exceed the functionality and utility of third-party applications.
- Commit to prioritizing a significant reduction in spam, misinformation, bigotry, and illegal content on Reddit.
- Guarantee that any future developments which may impact moderators, contributors, or stakeholders will be announced no less than one fiscal quarter before they are scheduled to go into effect.
- Work together with longstanding moderators to establish a reasonable roadmap and deadline for accomplishing all of the above.
- Affirm that efforts meant to keep Reddit accountable to its commitments and deadlines will hereafter not be met with insults, threats, removals, or hostility.
- Publicly affirm all of the above by way of updating Reddit’s User Agreement and Reddit’s Moderator Code of Conduct to include reasonable expectations and requirements for administrators’ behavior. 
- Implement and fill a senior-level role (with decision-making and policy-shaping power) of ""Moderator Advocate"" at Reddit, with a required qualification for the position being robust experience as a volunteer Reddit moderator.

Reddit is unique amongst social-media sites in that its lifeblood – its multitude of moderators and contributors – consists entirely of volunteers. We populate and curate the platform’s many communities, thereby providing a welcoming and engaging environment for all of its visitors. We receive little in the way of thanks for these efforts, but we frequently endure abuse, threats, attacks, and exposure to truly reprehensible media. Historically, we have trusted that Reddit’s administrators have the best interests of the platform and its users (be they moderators, contributors, participants, or lurkers) at heart; that while Reddit may be a for-profit company, it nonetheless recognizes and appreciates the value that Redditors provide. 

That trust has been all but entirely eroded… but we hope that together, we can begin to rebuild it.

In simplest terms, Reddit, we implore you: **Remember the human**. 

We look forward to your response by Thursday, June 29th, 2023.

Godzilla 2014 deserved better sequels.,maruhadapurpurine,258,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1d5yorj/godzilla_2014_deserved_better_sequels/,121,"I finally got around to watching those monsterverse movies this week and boy... how did they manage to peak right at the start?

The 2014 movie is so vastly above the sequels in tone and quality that it's hard to believe they belong in the same continuity. Godzilla 2014 is as grounded as a story about a giant lizard monster fighting other giant monsters can be. The human element is much simpler and easier to empathize with. The effects feel years ahead of what came after too. The destruction caused by the monsters fighting feel appropriately bleak while also being super awesome to watch.

I don't think any moment in the sequels ever got me nearly as hyped as when Godzilla shoots his atomic breath down the MUTO's throat. Hell even his first full appearance at Hawaii got me more hyped than anything in the sequels to be honest.

Yeah, I will be the first to agree that for a Godzilla movie there isn't nearly enough Godzilla in it, but maybe they were on to something by keeping his presence so brief until later. The sequels have monsters galore and they're no better for it.

The whole time watching King of the Monsters I was only ever mildly amused by all of it. Gidorah just looked goofy as fuck most of the time because it clashes so much with the semi realism that Godzilla was designed with. The human plot is absolutely awful and should have been cut down by a lot.

Godzilla vs Kong is alright... Sure the fight scenes are cool, but once again the human characters detract way more than add anything to it, especially the podcast guy and the kids. Why are they even here? The stranger things girl's story was over already, why is she back?

And the sci-fi shit was already too much last movie, in this one they just jump the shark completely. It's like they couldn't figure out how to keep the story going so the movies just got progressively dumber with each entry, like a kid mashing toys together. Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy a movie like that, but when you compare it with the 2014 movie it is just so disappointing to see such a major departure in direction. It's like they lost the plot.

Kong Skull Island was fun though. Nice twist to have Samual L Jackson as the villain. I would rank this one just below Godzilla 2014. Even if the tone between them is still completely different at least Skull Island managed to keep itself together by succeeding in the same areas that Godzilla did. Straightforward, centered plot, the human characters contribute to the story instead of detracting from it, great action scenes.

The only one left is Godzilla x Kong and I'm already not expecting anything aside some dumb but fun fight scenes, and just hoping the human characters are cut down to a minimum.

On a side note I also watched Shin Godzilla and will watch Godzilla Minus One as well. The take is so different you can't even really compare them. Shin Godzilla is much more of a political commentary on the japanese government than anything else. I guess that keeps the line much closer to the OG Godzilla movie.

Edit: I finished watching Minus One and GxK The New Empire so here are my brief thoughts.

Minus One: Obviously not related to the monsterverse but it pretty much nails the human element in a Godzilla movie. Even when you know where te story is going it still hits the emotional notes. Because of that I would say it is overall better than the 2014 version (though I would still say that 2014 has better hype moments. You just can't top that atomic breath straight down the MUTO's mouth.)

GxK: This movie is completely ridiculous in every way possible and it just cemented my thoughts on this. Regardless of what I think about the quality of the sequels, these movies absolutely shouldn't be in the same universe. The tone is too different, the world is simply not the same. There is no way you can watch GxK and then look at 2014 Godzilla and say they fit together. It just doesn't work. Again, I'm not against movies like this. They have an audience, and I can honestly say I had some fun watching it, but it should've been its own thing and not related to the 2014 movie, which in turn deserved a sequel much more in line with its tone and vision of the Godzilla universe.",1717281094.0,Text

"Debate, dissent, and protest on Reddit",spez,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/pbmy5y/debate_dissent_and_protest_on_reddit/,1,"Hey everyone–

The pandemic has been extremely hard on many of us. We believe the best way forward for everyone is to [get vaccinated](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) and continue to follow [CDC guidance on masking](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html). Throughout the pandemic, we have also provided COVID-related resources to support our volunteer moderators, users, and communities, including a dedicated AMA series connecting users with [authoritative experts on coronavirus](https://redditblog.com/2020/03/02/expert-conversation-on-coronavirus/) and [vaccines](https://redditblog.com/2021/01/28/introducing-a-new-reddit-ama-series-everything-you-want-to-know-about-covid-19-vaccines/), as well as deploying homepage and search page banners directing users to the CDC and r/Coronavirus.

We appreciate that not everyone agrees with the current approach to getting us all through the pandemic, and some are still wary of vaccinations. Dissent is a part of Reddit and the foundation of democracy. Reddit is a place for open and authentic discussion and debate. This includes conversations that question or disagree with popular consensus. This includes conversations that criticize those that disagree with the majority opinion. This includes protests that criticize or object to our decisions on which communities to ban from the platform.

While we appreciate the sentiment of those demanding that we ban more communities that challenge consensus views on the pandemic, we continue to believe in the good of our communities and hope that we collectively approach the challenges of the pandemic with empathy, compassion, and a willingness to understand what others are going through, even when their viewpoint on the pandemic is different from yours. 

When it comes to COVID-19 specifically, what we know and what are the current best practices from authoritative sources, like the CDC, evolve continuously with new learnings. Given the rapid state of change, we believe it is best to enable communities to engage in debate and dissent, and for us to link to the CDC wherever appropriate. While we believe the CDC is the best and most up to date source of information regarding COVID-19, disagreeing with them is not against our policies.

However, manipulating or cheating Reddit to amplify any particular viewpoint is against our policies, and we will continue to action communities that do so or that violate any of our other rules, including those dedicated to fraud (e.g. fake vaccine cards) or encouraging harm (e.g. consuming bleach); and we will continue to use our quarantine tool to link to authoritative sources and warn people they may encounter unsound advice. We humbly ask and encourage everyone to report content that may violate our policies.

**We didn’t make this decision lightly.**

We’re hopeful that spirit will continue in the future. 

**What this means for future exchanges in 2021**

In preparation for retiring Reddit Gifts after the final exchange at the end of 2021, we will be taking the following actions: 

* In order to limit incomplete exchanges, we have disabled the creation of any new Reddit Gifts accounts. If you have an existing Reddit Gifts account, we would love it if you would participate with us in these final exchanges. 
* Any incomplete exchanges will result in a ban from the remaining Reddit Gifts exchanges.
* This morning, we turned off the ability to buy [Elves](https://www.redditgifts.com/Elves/). If you purchased an Elves membership and have remaining months after the 2021 Secret Santa Exchange, we will email you about your refund options then. If you have specific concerns about your Elves membership, please reach out to Reddit Gifts [support](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000825092). 

These changes have been put in place to ensure that these last exchanges are enjoyable for the legacy Reddit Gifts users. We want to celebrate the end of Reddit Gifts with the community that we’ve built so far. 

Countless acts of love, heroism, compassion, support, growth and hilarity happened through Reddit Gifts, and those memories will live on in the hearts of our community. We’re working on ways to capture these moments and look forward to seeing how the spirit and connection of exchanging gifts with strangers will live on.

As of today, the employee in question is no longer employed by Reddit. We built a relationship with her first as a mod and then through her contractor work on RPAN. We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her. 

We’ve put significant effort into improving how we handle doxxing and harassment, and this employee was the subject of both. In this case, we over-indexed on protection, which had serious consequences in terms of enforcement actions. 

* On March 9th, we added extra protections for this employee, including actioning content that mentioned the employee’s name or shared personal information on third-party sites, which we reserve for serious cases of harassment and doxxing.
* On March 22nd, a news article about this employee was posted by a mod of r/ukpolitics. The article was removed and the submitter banned by the aforementioned rules. When contacted by the moderators of r/ukpolitics, we reviewed the actions, and reversed the ban on the moderator, and we informed the r/ukpolitics moderation team that we had restored the mod.
* We updated our rules to flag potential harassment for human review.

Debate and criticism have always been and always will be central to conversation on Reddit—including discussion about public figures and Reddit itself—as long as they are not used as vehicles for harassment. Mentioning a public figure’s name should not get you banned.

We care deeply for Reddit and appreciate that you do too. We understand the anger and confusion about these issues and their bigger implications. The employee is no longer with Reddit, and we’ll be evolving a number of relevant internal policies.

Today we’re testing a new way to discuss political ads (and announcements),spez,17309,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/ipitt0/today_were_testing_a_new_way_to_discuss_political/,2,"In case you missed [the](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/ikxsst/this_reddit_billboard_advertisement_for_their/) [billboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ilhck2/saw_one_in_the_wild_make_sure_to_vote_illinois/), [blog posts](https://redditblog.com/2020/09/01/its-national-poll-worker-recruitment-day-become-a-poll-worker-this-election-and-help-power-the-polls-in-your-community/), and [AMAs](https://redditblog.com/2020/08/25/voting-in-america/), we’re doing our best to encourage people on and off Reddit to vote this year. Along with our [Up the Vote campaign](https://redditblog.com/2020/07/29/up-the-vote-reddits-irl-2020-voting-campaign/) and [ongoing security and safety work](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/) to guard against shenanigans, we’ve also been evolving how we handle another important aspect of the election process: **political ads**.

## First, some background

Political ads have been a relatively quiet part of Reddit for many years. Last year, in thinking through what the right balance was between unfettered political ads and prohibiting them altogether for 2020 (both approaches that other platforms have taken), we decided on [a policy we felt was the best approach for Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/g0s6tn/changes_to_reddits_political_ads_policy/): no misinformation, human review of the ads and where they link, a subreddit listing all political ads ([r/RedditPoliticalAds](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditPoliticalAds/)), and a requirement to keep comments on for 24 hours.

Since debuting this policy earlier this year, the last condition (requiring comments to remain on) has enabled redditors to discuss political ads—providing more context in the comments and even offering counterarguments—but so far it’s only been lightly used. As we get closer to November, however, the prominence of and discussion around political ads will increase, and, with it, the need for a clear moderation system for these comments.

## The problem we’re addressing

As I mentioned [a couple months back](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/fwdxoty/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3&depth=2), unmoderated spaces on Reddit are an area we want to improve, from Modmail to PM’s, and political ads pose a unique challenge.

If the OP of a political ad (i.e., a campaign) moderates the comments, it’s problematic: they might remove dissenting perspectives. And if we (the admins) moderate the comments of a political ad, it’s even more problematic, putting us in the position of either moderating too much or too little, with inevitable accusations of bias either way.

The problem, we realized, is similar to what we see in r/announcements: lots of people commenting on a highly visible post outside the context of a community. It’s fair to say that r/announcements isn’t really a community; it lacks the culture, cohesion, and moderation that benefit most other subreddits, and as a result, the quality of conversation has deteriorated as the audience has grown.

Ultimately, conversations really only happen in the context of a community, and neither r/announcements nor political ads with comments on provide this. We believe we can foster better discussion on both with a different approach.

## What we’re testing today

Instead of having the usual free-for-all of comments on the r/announcements post itself, we are trying out a new experience today that encourages discussion of this post within other communities—an approach we hope works for political ads as well.

Below is a stickied comment with a link to submit this post to other communities on Reddit and a list of those discussion posts. The stickied comment will update automatically with new posts.

A few other details to note for this test:

* **The discussion posts are like any other post**, which means they can be voted on by users and removed by mods.
* **Communities that don’t want to participate don’t have to.** (If you’re a mod of a community where a user attempts to crosspost this, you will get a Modmail alerting you to this with [opt-out instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/).)
* **Individual community rules apply to these posts just as any other**, so read the rules before attempting to bring the discussion into a completely unrelated community.
* **Our stickied comment will link to discussions only from communities subject to our ads allow list.** Communities that have already opted not to appear in r/all won’t appear in the comment either, even if there is a discussion of this post there.
* **After today’s test, we will likely test this system with political ads.**

This test will be a success if there are a variety of posts and conversations about this post, even—and perhaps particularly—if they are critical.

## How we’re answering questions

r/announcements posts have an important difference from political ads: I treat them as AMAs and do my best to answer questions and respond to criticism (both of which I appreciate). With this approach, I expect doing so will be more difficult (at least this first time). However, the point of this test is not to make you hunt for our answers or for us to reply to fewer questions, and we don’t intend to use this approach for all our admin posts (e.g., in r/ModNews, r/changelog, r/ModSupport, and others, which are smaller subreddits that still work well).

For today, we’re going to make the first link of this post to r/ModNews and start by answering mods’ questions there. In a future announcement, we may ask a specific community if they would host us for the discussion that day (depending on what the announcement is) and set that as an official destination for discussion, like a regular AMA.

Additionally, I’ll do my best to find other places to respond, and we’ll maintain another comment below this post to list replies we’ve given outside of r/announcements so you can easily find our responses (which was a feature request from [our post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/g3r4xpm/) last week).

Ultimately, the goal of this test is to enable Reddit to do what Reddit does best: facilitate conversations (within the context of a community), provide commentary on political ads the way redditors already do on news and politics daily (sharing more information and calling bullshit in the comments when necessary), and extend the discussion well beyond the scope of the original post.

Thank you for participating. We hope this approach sets the stage for successful commentary not just today but down the road on political ads as well.

&#x200B;

**Edit (9/28/20):** Update: After initial testing and a few small tweaks to the sorting and score display of the links in stickied comments like the one below, we’ll be using this discussion system on political ads moving forward. 

As I mentioned, our goal with this approach was to encourage these types of discussions to happen within the context of a community. While this feature is completely optional for communities (opt-out instructions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/)), we were pleased overall with the level of engagement that we saw from communities and users on this test post.

We’re still exploring how we’ll use this feature for r/announcements posts and how we can work with specific communities to have discussions about them.

Update to Our Content Policy,spez,21320,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/,38595,"[A few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/), we committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate. After talking extensively with mods, outside organizations, and our own teams, we’re updating our content policy today and enforcing it (with your help).

## First, a quick recap

Since our last post, here’s what we’ve been doing:

* **We brought on a** [**new Board member**](https://redditblog.com/2020/06/10/reddit-welcomes-michael-seibel-to-board-of-directors/).
* **We held policy calls with mods**—both from established Mod Councils and from communities disproportionately targeted with hate—and discussed areas where we can do better to action bad actors, clarify our policies, make mods' lives easier, and concretely reduce hate.
   * You can find [detailed notes from our All-Council mod call here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hi3nkr/the_mod_conversations_that_went_into_todays), including specific product work we discussed.
* **We developed our enforcement plan**, including both our immediate actions (e.g., today’s bans) and long-term investments (tackling the most critical work discussed in our mod calls, sustainably enforcing the new policies, and advancing Reddit’s community governance).

From our conversations with mods and outside experts, it’s clear that while we’ve gotten better in some areas—like actioning violations at the community level, [scaling enforcement efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/hbiuas/reddit_security_report_june_18_2020/), measurably reducing hateful experiences like harassment [year over year](https://www.adl.org/online-hate-2020#results)—we still have a long way to go to address the gaps in our policies and enforcement to date.

These include addressing questions our policies have left unanswered (like whether hate speech is allowed or even protected on Reddit), aspects of our product and mod tools that are still too easy for individual bad actors to abuse (inboxes, chats, modmail), and areas where we can do better to partner with our mods and communities who want to combat the same hateful conduct we do.

Ultimately, it’s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. In the near term, this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.

## New Policy

This is the [new content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). Here’s what’s different:

* It starts with a statement of our vision for Reddit and our communities, including the basic expectations we have for all communities and users.
* **Rule 1** explicitly states that communities and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.
   * There is an expanded definition of what constitutes a violation of this rule, along with specific examples, in our [Help Center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).
* **Rule 2** ties together our previous rules on prohibited behavior with an ask to abide by community rules and post with authentic, personal interest.
   * Debate and creativity are welcome, but spam and malicious attempts to interfere with other communities are not.
* The other rules are the same in spirit but have been rewritten for clarity and inclusiveness.

Alongside the change to the content policy, we are initially banning about 2000 subreddits, the vast majority of which are inactive. Of these communities, about [200](https://www.redditstatic.com/banned-subreddits-june-2020.txt) have more than 10 daily users. Both r/The_Donald and r/ChapoTrapHouse were included.

All communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so, despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1), antagonized us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8), and its mods have refused to meet our most basic expectations. Until now, we’ve worked in good faith to help them preserve the community as a space for its users—through warnings, mod changes, quarantining, and more.

Though smaller, r/ChapoTrapHouse was banned for similar reasons: They consistently host rule-breaking content and their mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.

To be clear, views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit—but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith, without exception.

## Our commitment

Our policies will never be perfect, with new edge cases that inevitably lead us to evolve them in the future. And as users, you will always have more context, community vernacular, and cultural values to inform the standards set within your communities than we as site admins or any AI ever could.

But just as our content moderation cannot scale effectively without your support, you need more support from us as well, and we admit we have fallen short towards this end. We are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors, abusive behaviors, and toxic communities that undermine our mission and get in the way of the creativity, discussions, and communities that bring us all to Reddit in the first place. We hope that our progress towards this commitment, with today’s update and those to come, makes Reddit a place you enjoy and are proud to be a part of for many years to come.

Edit: After digesting feedback, we made a clarifying change to our help center article for [Promoting Hate Based on Identity or Vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).",1593450006.0,Text
"Upcoming changes to our content policy, our board, and where we’re going from here",spez,40922,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/,40768,"**TL;DR: We’re working with mods to change our content policy to explicitly address hate.** u/kn0thing **has resigned from our board to fill his seat with a Black candidate, a request we will honor. I want to take responsibility for the history of our policies over the years that got us here, and we still have work to do.**

After watching people across the country mourn and demand an end to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people, I wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it, a duty to speak out.

Earlier this week, I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, “How can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?”

These questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy. 

Over the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities—across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could’ve imagined when we first created subreddits—and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.

However, as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:

* Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. 
* Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. 
* Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.

We are already working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it’s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.

We will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn’t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.

And just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he’s done for us over the years.

At the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.

In the early days of Reddit, 2005–2006, our idealistic “policy” was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our “policy.” 

I left Reddit from 2010–2015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit’s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). 

When I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what’s acceptable on Reddit and what’s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were “making Reddit worse” but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. 

While we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity—and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules, but also isn’t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.

This inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, “Breaking Reddit” was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.

The majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. 

Despite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.

I will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.

Thanks,

Godzilla 2014 deserved better sequels.,maruhadapurpurine,258,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1d5yorj/godzilla_2014_deserved_better_sequels/,121,"I finally got around to watching those monsterverse movies this week and boy... how did they manage to peak right at the start?

The 2014 movie is so vastly above the sequels in tone and quality that it's hard to believe they belong in the same continuity. Godzilla 2014 is as grounded as a story about a giant lizard monster fighting other giant monsters can be. The human element is much simpler and easier to empathize with. The effects feel years ahead of what came after too. The destruction caused by the monsters fighting feel appropriately bleak while also being super awesome to watch.

I don't think any moment in the sequels ever got me nearly as hyped as when Godzilla shoots his atomic breath down the MUTO's throat. Hell even his first full appearance at Hawaii got me more hyped than anything in the sequels to be honest.

Yeah, I will be the first to agree that for a Godzilla movie there isn't nearly enough Godzilla in it, but maybe they were on to something by keeping his presence so brief until later. The sequels have monsters galore and they're no better for it.

The whole time watching King of the Monsters I was only ever mildly amused by all of it. Gidorah just looked goofy as fuck most of the time because it clashes so much with the semi realism that Godzilla was designed with. The human plot is absolutely awful and should have been cut down by a lot.

Godzilla vs Kong is alright... Sure the fight scenes are cool, but once again the human characters detract way more than add anything to it, especially the podcast guy and the kids. Why are they even here? The stranger things girl's story was over already, why is she back?

And the sci-fi shit was already too much last movie, in this one they just jump the shark completely. It's like they couldn't figure out how to keep the story going so the movies just got progressively dumber with each entry, like a kid mashing toys together. Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy a movie like that, but when you compare it with the 2014 movie it is just so disappointing to see such a major departure in direction. It's like they lost the plot.

Kong Skull Island was fun though. Nice twist to have Samual L Jackson as the villain. I would rank this one just below Godzilla 2014. Even if the tone between them is still completely different at least Skull Island managed to keep itself together by succeeding in the same areas that Godzilla did. Straightforward, centered plot, the human characters contribute to the story instead of detracting from it, great action scenes.

The only one left is Godzilla x Kong and I'm already not expecting anything aside some dumb but fun fight scenes, and just hoping the human characters are cut down to a minimum.

On a side note I also watched Shin Godzilla and will watch Godzilla Minus One as well. The take is so different you can't even really compare them. Shin Godzilla is much more of a political commentary on the japanese government than anything else. I guess that keeps the line much closer to the OG Godzilla movie.

Edit: I finished watching Minus One and GxK The New Empire so here are my brief thoughts.

Minus One: Obviously not related to the monsterverse but it pretty much nails the human element in a Godzilla movie. Even when you know where te story is going it still hits the emotional notes. Because of that I would say it is overall better than the 2014 version (though I would still say that 2014 has better hype moments. You just can't top that atomic breath straight down the MUTO's mouth.)

GxK: This movie is completely ridiculous in every way possible and it just cemented my thoughts on this. Regardless of what I think about the quality of the sequels, these movies absolutely shouldn't be in the same universe. The tone is too different, the world is simply not the same. There is no way you can watch GxK and then look at 2014 Godzilla and say they fit together. It just doesn't work. Again, I'm not against movies like this. They have an audience, and I can honestly say I had some fun watching it, but it should've been its own thing and not related to the 2014 movie, which in turn deserved a sequel much more in line with its tone and vision of the Godzilla universe.",1717281094.0,Text

"Debate, dissent, and protest on Reddit",spez,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/pbmy5y/debate_dissent_and_protest_on_reddit/,1,"Hey everyone–

The pandemic has been extremely hard on many of us. We believe the best way forward for everyone is to [get vaccinated](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) and continue to follow [CDC guidance on masking](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html). Throughout the pandemic, we have also provided COVID-related resources to support our volunteer moderators, users, and communities, including a dedicated AMA series connecting users with [authoritative experts on coronavirus](https://redditblog.com/2020/03/02/expert-conversation-on-coronavirus/) and [vaccines](https://redditblog.com/2021/01/28/introducing-a-new-reddit-ama-series-everything-you-want-to-know-about-covid-19-vaccines/), as well as deploying homepage and search page banners directing users to the CDC and r/Coronavirus.

We appreciate that not everyone agrees with the current approach to getting us all through the pandemic, and some are still wary of vaccinations. Dissent is a part of Reddit and the foundation of democracy. Reddit is a place for open and authentic discussion and debate. This includes conversations that question or disagree with popular consensus. This includes conversations that criticize those that disagree with the majority opinion. This includes protests that criticize or object to our decisions on which communities to ban from the platform.

While we appreciate the sentiment of those demanding that we ban more communities that challenge consensus views on the pandemic, we continue to believe in the good of our communities and hope that we collectively approach the challenges of the pandemic with empathy, compassion, and a willingness to understand what others are going through, even when their viewpoint on the pandemic is different from yours. 

When it comes to COVID-19 specifically, what we know and what are the current best practices from authoritative sources, like the CDC, evolve continuously with new learnings. Given the rapid state of change, we believe it is best to enable communities to engage in debate and dissent, and for us to link to the CDC wherever appropriate. While we believe the CDC is the best and most up to date source of information regarding COVID-19, disagreeing with them is not against our policies.

However, manipulating or cheating Reddit to amplify any particular viewpoint is against our policies, and we will continue to action communities that do so or that violate any of our other rules, including those dedicated to fraud (e.g. fake vaccine cards) or encouraging harm (e.g. consuming bleach); and we will continue to use our quarantine tool to link to authoritative sources and warn people they may encounter unsound advice. We humbly ask and encourage everyone to report content that may violate our policies.

* Any incomplete exchanges will result in a ban from the remaining Reddit Gifts exchanges.
* This morning, we turned off the ability to buy [Elves](https://www.redditgifts.com/Elves/).

As of today, the employee in question is no longer employed by Reddit. We built a relationship with her first as a mod and then through her contractor work on RPAN. We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her. 

We’ve put significant effort into improving how we handle doxxing and harassment, and this employee was the subject of both. In this case, we over-indexed on protection, which had serious consequences in terms of enforcement actions. 

* On March 9th, we added extra protections for this employee, including actioning content that mentioned the employee’s name or shared personal information on third-party sites, which we reserve for serious cases of harassment and doxxing.
* On March 22nd, a news article about this employee was posted by a mod of r/ukpolitics. The article was removed and the submitter banned by the aforementioned rules. When contacted by the moderators of r/ukpolitics, we reviewed the actions, and reversed the ban on the moderator, and we informed the r/ukpolitics moderation team that we had restored the mod.
* We updated our rules to flag potential harassment for human review.

Debate and criticism have always been and always will be central to conversation on Reddit—including discussion about public figures and Reddit itself—as long as they are not used as vehicles for harassment. Mentioning a public figure’s name should not get you banned.

Along with our [Up the Vote campaign](https://redditblog.com/2020/07/29/up-the-vote-reddits-irl-2020-voting-campaign/) and [ongoing security and safety work](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/) to guard against shenanigans, we’ve also been evolving how we handle another important aspect of the election process: **political ads**.

## First, some background

Political ads have been a relatively quiet part of Reddit for many years. Last year, in thinking through what the right balance was between unfettered political ads and prohibiting them altogether for 2020 (both approaches that other platforms have taken), we decided on [a policy we felt was the best approach for Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/g0s6tn/changes_to_reddits_political_ads_policy/): no misinformation, human review of the ads and where they link, a subreddit listing all political ads ([r/RedditPoliticalAds](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditPoliticalAds/)), and a requirement to keep comments on for 24 hours.

Since debuting this policy earlier this year, the last condition (requiring comments to remain on) has enabled redditors to discuss political ads—providing more context in the comments and even offering counterarguments—but so far it’s only been lightly used. As we get closer to November, however, the prominence of and discussion around political ads will increase, and, with it, the need for a clear moderation system for these comments.

## The problem we’re addressing

As I mentioned [a couple months back](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/fwdxoty/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3&depth=2), unmoderated spaces on Reddit are an area we want to improve, from Modmail to PM’s, and political ads pose a unique challenge.

If the OP of a political ad (i.e., a campaign) moderates the comments, it’s problematic: they might remove dissenting perspectives. And if we (the admins) moderate the comments of a political ad, it’s even more problematic, putting us in the position of either moderating too much or too little, with inevitable accusations of bias either way.

The problem, we realized, is similar to what we see in r/announcements: lots of people commenting on a highly visible post outside the context of a community. It’s fair to say that r/announcements isn’t really a community; it lacks the culture, cohesion, and moderation that benefit most other subreddits, and as a result, the quality of conversation has deteriorated as the audience has grown.

Ultimately, conversations really only happen in the context of a community, and neither r/announcements nor political ads with comments on provide this. We believe we can foster better discussion on both with a different approach.

## What we’re testing today

Instead of having the usual free-for-all of comments on the r/announcements post itself, we are trying out a new experience today that encourages discussion of this post within other communities—an approach we hope works for political ads as well.

Below is a stickied comment with a link to submit this post to other communities on Reddit and a list of those discussion posts. The stickied comment will update automatically with new posts.

A few other details to note for this test:

* **The discussion posts are like any other post**, which means they can be voted on by users and removed by mods.
* **Communities that don’t want to participate don’t have to.** (If you’re a mod of a community where a user attempts to crosspost this, you will get a Modmail alerting you to this with [opt-out instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/).)
* **Individual community rules apply to these posts just as any other**, so read the rules before attempting to bring the discussion into a completely unrelated community.
* **Our stickied comment will link to discussions only from communities subject to our ads allow list.** Communities that have already opted not to appear in r/all won’t appear in the comment either, even if there is a discussion of this post there.
* **After today’s test, we will likely test this system with political ads.**

This test will be a success if there are a variety of posts and conversations about this post, even—and perhaps particularly—if they are critical.

## How we’re answering questions

r/announcements posts have an important difference from political ads: I treat them as AMAs and do my best to answer questions and respond to criticism (both of which I appreciate). With this approach, I expect doing so will be more difficult (at least this first time). However, the point of this test is not to make you hunt for our answers or for us to reply to fewer questions, and we don’t intend to use this approach for all our admin posts (e.g., in r/ModNews, r/changelog, r/ModSupport, and others, which are smaller subreddits that still work well).

For today, we’re going to make the first link of this post to r/ModNews and start by answering mods’ questions there. In a future announcement, we may ask a specific community if they would host us for the discussion that day (depending on what the announcement is) and set that as an official destination for discussion, like a regular AMA.

Additionally, I’ll do my best to find other places to respond, and we’ll maintain another comment below this post to list replies we’ve given outside of r/announcements so you can easily find our responses (which was a feature request from [our post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/g3r4xpm/) last week).

Ultimately, the goal of this test is to enable Reddit to do what Reddit does best: facilitate conversations (within the context of a community), provide commentary on political ads the way redditors already do on news and politics daily (sharing more information and calling bullshit in the comments when necessary), and extend the discussion well beyond the scope of the original post.

Thank you for participating. We hope this approach sets the stage for successful commentary not just today but down the road on political ads as well.

**Edit (9/28/20):** Update: After initial testing and a few small tweaks to the sorting and score display of the links in stickied comments like the one below, we’ll be using this discussion system on political ads moving forward. 

As I mentioned, our goal with this approach was to encourage these types of discussions to happen within the context of a community. While this feature is completely optional for communities (opt-out instructions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/)), we were pleased overall with the level of engagement that we saw from communities and users on this test post.

We’re still exploring how we’ll use this feature for r/announcements posts and how we can work with specific communities to have discussions about them. In the meantime, you can see our updated political ads policy on our [Advertising Policy Help Page](https://advertising.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-advertising-policy/reddit-advertising-policy-overview).",1599667576.0,Text

Update to Our Content Policy,spez,21317,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/,38595,"[A few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/), we committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate. After talking extensively with mods, outside organizations, and our own teams, we’re updating our content policy today and enforcing it (with your help).

## First, a quick recap

Since our last post, here’s what we’ve been doing:

* **We brought on a** [**new Board member**](https://redditblog.com/2020/06/10/reddit-welcomes-michael-seibel-to-board-of-directors/).
* **We held policy calls with mods**—both from established Mod Councils and from communities disproportionately targeted with hate—and discussed areas where we can do better to action bad actors, clarify our policies, make mods' lives easier, and concretely reduce hate.
   * You can find [detailed notes from our All-Council mod call here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hi3nkr/the_mod_conversations_that_went_into_todays), including specific product work we discussed.
* **We developed our enforcement plan**, including both our immediate actions (e.g., today’s bans) and long-term investments (tackling the most critical work discussed in our mod calls, sustainably enforcing the new policies, and advancing Reddit’s community governance).

From our conversations with mods and outside experts, it’s clear that while we’ve gotten better in some areas—like actioning violations at the community level, [scaling enforcement efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/hbiuas/reddit_security_report_june_18_2020/), measurably reducing hateful experiences like harassment [year over year](https://www.adl.org/online-hate-2020#results)—we still have a long way to go to address the gaps in our policies and enforcement to date.

These include addressing questions our policies have left unanswered (like whether hate speech is allowed or even protected on Reddit), aspects of our product and mod tools that are still too easy for individual bad actors to abuse (inboxes, chats, modmail), and areas where we can do better to partner with our mods and communities who want to combat the same hateful conduct we do.

Ultimately, it’s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. In the near term, this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.

## New Policy

This is the [new content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). Here’s what’s different:

* It starts with a statement of our vision for Reddit and our communities, including the basic expectations we have for all communities and users.
* **Rule 1** explicitly states that communities and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.
   * There is an expanded definition of what constitutes a violation of this rule, along with specific examples, in our [Help Center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).
* **Rule 2** ties together our previous rules on prohibited behavior with an ask to abide by community rules and post with authentic, personal interest.
   * Debate and creativity are welcome, but spam and malicious attempts to interfere with other communities are not.
* The other rules are the same in spirit but have been rewritten for clarity and inclusiveness.

Alongside the change to the content policy, we are initially banning about 2000 subreddits, the vast majority of which are inactive. Of these communities, about [200](https://www.redditstatic.com/banned-subreddits-june-2020.txt) have more than 10 daily users. Both r/The_Donald and r/ChapoTrapHouse were included.

All communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so, despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1), antagonized us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8), and its mods have refused to meet our most basic expectations. Until now, we’ve worked in good faith to help them preserve the community as a space for its users—through warnings, mod changes, quarantining, and more.

Though smaller, r/ChapoTrapHouse was banned for similar reasons: They consistently host rule-breaking content and their mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.

To be clear, views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit—but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith, without exception.

## Our commitment

Our policies will never be perfect, with new edge cases that inevitably lead us to evolve them in the future. And as users, you will always have more context, community vernacular, and cultural values to inform the standards set within your communities than we as site admins or any AI ever could.

But just as our content moderation cannot scale effectively without your support, you need more support from us as well, and we admit we have fallen short towards this end. We are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors, abusive behaviors, and toxic communities that undermine our mission and get in the way of the creativity, discussions, and communities that bring us all to Reddit in the first place. We hope that our progress towards this commitment, with today’s update and those to come, makes Reddit a place you enjoy and are proud to be a part of for many years to come.

Edit: After digesting feedback, we made a clarifying change to our help center article for [Promoting Hate Based on Identity or Vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).",1593450006.0,Text
"Upcoming changes to our content policy, our board, and where we’re going from here",spez,40930,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/,40768,"**TL;DR: We’re working with mods to change our content policy to explicitly address hate.** u/kn0thing **has resigned from our board to fill his seat with a Black candidate, a request we will honor. I want to take responsibility for the history of our policies over the years that got us here, and we still have work to do.**

After watching people across the country mourn and demand an end to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people, I wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it, a duty to speak out.

Earlier this week, I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, “How can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?”

These questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy. 

Over the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities—across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could’ve imagined when we first created subreddits—and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.

However, as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:

* Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. 
* Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. 
* Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.

We are already working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it’s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.

We will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn’t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.

And just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he’s done for us over the years.

At the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.

In the early days of Reddit, 2005–2006, our idealistic “policy” was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our “policy.” 

I left Reddit from 2010–2015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit’s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). 

When I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what’s acceptable on Reddit and what’s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were “making Reddit worse” but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. 

While we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity—and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules, but also isn’t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.

This inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, “Breaking Reddit” was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.

The majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. 

Despite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.

I will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.

Thanks,

"Debate, dissent, and protest on Reddit",spez,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/pbmy5y/debate_dissent_and_protest_on_reddit/,1,"Hey everyone–

The pandemic has been extremely hard on many of us. We believe the best way forward for everyone is to [get vaccinated](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) and continue to follow [CDC guidance on masking](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html). Throughout the pandemic, we have also provided COVID-related resources to support our volunteer moderators, users, and communities, including a dedicated AMA series connecting users with [authoritative experts on coronavirus](https://redditblog.com/2020/03/02/expert-conversation-on-coronavirus/) and [vaccines](https://redditblog.com/2021/01/28/introducing-a-new-reddit-ama-series-everything-you-want-to-know-about-covid-19-vaccines/), as well as deploying homepage and search page banners directing users to the CDC and r/Coronavirus.

We appreciate that not everyone agrees with the current approach to getting us all through the pandemic, and some are still wary of vaccinations. Dissent is a part of Reddit and the foundation of democracy. Reddit is a place for open and authentic discussion and debate. This includes conversations that question or disagree with popular consensus. This includes conversations that criticize those that disagree with the majority opinion. This includes protests that criticize or object to our decisions on which communities to ban from the platform.

While we appreciate the sentiment of those demanding that we ban more communities that challenge consensus views on the pandemic, we continue to believe in the good of our communities and hope that we collectively approach the challenges of the pandemic with empathy, compassion, and a willingness to understand what others are going through, even when their viewpoint on the pandemic is different from yours. 

When it comes to COVID-19 specifically, what we know and what are the current best practices from authoritative sources, like the CDC, evolve continuously with new learnings. Given the rapid state of change, we believe it is best to enable communities to engage in debate and dissent, and for us to link to the CDC wherever appropriate. While we believe the CDC is the best and most up to date source of information regarding COVID-19, disagreeing with them is not against our policies.

However, manipulating or cheating Reddit to amplify any particular viewpoint is against our policies, and we will continue to action communities that do so or that violate any of our other rules, including those dedicated to fraud (e.g. fake vaccine cards) or encouraging harm (e.g. consuming bleach); and we will continue to use our quarantine tool to link to authoritative sources and warn people they may encounter unsound advice.

Sunsetting Secret Santa and Reddit Gifts,KeyserSosa,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/nw2hs6/sunsetting_secret_santa_and_reddit_gifts/,3432,"Today is a difficult one:. 2021 will be the last year of Reddit Gifts.  We will continue to run exchanges through the end of the year -- including the last ever Arbitrary Day (signups are [now open](https://www.redditgifts.com/exchanges/a-day-21/)) -- and will end with Secret Santa 2021. 

**We didn’t make this decision lightly.** 

We made the difficult decision to shut down Reddit Gifts and put more focus on enhancing the [user experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/mqcpcg/you_want_a_better_reddit_search_ok_were_on_it/) on Reddit - this includes [investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/ldgmfc/diamond_hands_on_the_data/) in the [foundation](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/nudfv1/the_rollout_of_reputation_service/) [of our](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/lb2p7a/a_new_video_player_updated_email_designs_mobile/) [platform](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/neknjg/evolving_beyond_100_billion_recommendations_a_day/) and [moderator tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/nk7p7j/new_updates_to_help_moderators_your_monthly/), making it more [accessible](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/mzse3p/control_over_your_followers_spring_avatar_gear_a/) for people around the world and evolving how people [engage](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/nmhmj0/q1_safety_security_report_may_27_2021/) with one another. 

The power of Reddit Gifts was never in the software, and has always belonged to the r/secretsanta community of gifters around the world, which has connected people and been an extension of our mission to bring community and belonging to everyone in the world. We’re hopeful that spirit will continue in the future. 

**What this means for future exchanges in 2021**

In preparation for retiring Reddit Gifts after the final exchange at the end of 2021, we will be taking the following actions: 

* In order to limit incomplete exchanges, we have disabled the creation of any new Reddit Gifts accounts. If you have an existing Reddit Gifts account, we would love it if you would participate with us in these final exchanges. 
* Any incomplete exchanges will result in a ban from the remaining Reddit Gifts exchanges.
* This morning, we turned off the ability to buy [Elves](https://www.redditgifts.com/Elves/). If you purchased an Elves membership and have remaining months after the 2021 Secret Santa Exchange, we will email you about your refund options then. If you have specific concerns about your Elves membership, please reach out to Reddit Gifts [support](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000825092). 

These changes have been put in place to ensure that these last exchanges are enjoyable for the legacy Reddit Gifts users. We want to celebrate the end of Reddit Gifts with the community that we’ve built so far. 

Countless acts of love, heroism, compassion, support, growth and hilarity happened through Reddit Gifts, and those memories will live on in the hearts of our community. We’re working on ways to capture these moments and look forward to seeing how the spirit and connection of exchanging gifts with strangers will live on. I’m sure you will all have a ton of questions, and we will be here to answer them.",1623262631.0,Text

An update on the recent issues surrounding a Reddit employee,spez,107373,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/mcisdf/an_update_on_the_recent_issues_surrounding_a/,36011,"We would like to give you all an update on the recent issues that have transpired concerning a specific Reddit employee, as well as provide you with context into actions that we took to prevent doxxing and harassment.

As of today, the employee in question is no longer employed by Reddit. We built a relationship with her first as a mod and then through her contractor work on RPAN. We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her. 

We’ve put significant effort into improving how we handle doxxing and harassment, and this employee was the subject of both. In this case, we over-indexed on protection, which had serious consequences in terms of enforcement actions. 

* On March 9th, we added extra protections for this employee, including actioning content that mentioned the employee’s name or shared personal information on third-party sites, which we reserve for serious cases of harassment and doxxing.
* On March 22nd, a news article about this employee was posted by a mod of r/ukpolitics. The article was removed and the submitter banned by the aforementioned rules. When contacted by the moderators of r/ukpolitics, we reviewed the actions, and reversed the ban on the moderator, and we informed the r/ukpolitics moderation team that we had restored the mod.
* We updated our rules to flag potential harassment for human review.

Debate and criticism have always been and always will be central to conversation on Reddit—including discussion about public figures and Reddit itself—as long as they are not used as vehicles for harassment. Mentioning a public figure’s name should not get you banned.

We care deeply for Reddit and appreciate that you do too. We understand the anger and confusion about these issues and their bigger implications. The employee is no longer with Reddit, and we’ll be evolving a number of relevant internal policies.

Today we’re testing a new way to discuss political ads (and announcements),spez,17307,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/ipitt0/today_were_testing_a_new_way_to_discuss_political/,2,"In case you missed [the](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/ikxsst/this_reddit_billboard_advertisement_for_their/) [billboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ilhck2/saw_one_in_the_wild_make_sure_to_vote_illinois/), [blog posts](https://redditblog.com/2020/09/01/its-national-poll-worker-recruitment-day-become-a-poll-worker-this-election-and-help-power-the-polls-in-your-community/), and [AMAs](https://redditblog.com/2020/08/25/voting-in-america/), we’re doing our best to encourage people on and off Reddit to vote this year. Along with our [Up the Vote campaign](https://redditblog.com/2020/07/29/up-the-vote-reddits-irl-2020-voting-campaign/) and [ongoing security and safety work](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/) to guard against shenanigans, we’ve also been evolving how we handle another important aspect of the election process: **political ads**.

## First, some background

Political ads have been a relatively quiet part of Reddit for many years. Last year, in thinking through what the right balance was between unfettered political ads and prohibiting them altogether for 2020 (both approaches that other platforms have taken), we decided on [a policy we felt was the best approach for Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/g0s6tn/changes_to_reddits_political_ads_policy/): no misinformation, human review of the ads and where they link, a subreddit listing all political ads ([r/RedditPoliticalAds](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditPoliticalAds/)), and a requirement to keep comments on for 24 hours.

Since debuting this policy earlier this year, the last condition (requiring comments to remain on) has enabled redditors to discuss political ads—providing more context in the comments and even offering counterarguments—but so far it’s only been lightly used. As we get closer to November, however, the prominence of and discussion around political ads will increase, and, with it, the need for a clear moderation system for these comments.

## The problem we’re addressing

As I mentioned [a couple months back](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/fwdxoty/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3&depth=2), unmoderated spaces on Reddit are an area we want to improve, from Modmail to PM’s, and political ads pose a unique challenge.

If the OP of a political ad (i.e., a campaign) moderates the comments, it’s problematic: they might remove dissenting perspectives. And if we (the admins) moderate the comments of a political ad, it’s even more problematic, putting us in the position of either moderating too much or too little, with inevitable accusations of bias either way.

The problem, we realized, is similar to what we see in r/announcements: lots of people commenting on a highly visible post outside the context of a community. It’s fair to say that r/announcements isn’t really a community; it lacks the culture, cohesion, and moderation that benefit most other subreddits, and as a result, the quality of conversation has deteriorated as the audience has grown.

Ultimately, conversations really only happen in the context of a community, and neither r/announcements nor political ads with comments on provide this. We believe we can foster better discussion on both with a different approach.

## What we’re testing today

Instead of having the usual free-for-all of comments on the r/announcements post itself, we are trying out a new experience today that encourages discussion of this post within other communities—an approach we hope works for political ads as well.

Below is a stickied comment with a link to submit this post to other communities on Reddit and a list of those discussion posts. The stickied comment will update automatically with new posts.

A few other details to note for this test:

* **The discussion posts are like any other post**, which means they can be voted on by users and removed by mods.
* **Communities that don’t want to participate don’t have to.** (If you’re a mod of a community where a user attempts to crosspost this, you will get a Modmail alerting you to this with [opt-out instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/).)
* **Individual community rules apply to these posts just as any other**, so read the rules before attempting to bring the discussion into a completely unrelated community.
* **Our stickied comment will link to discussions only from communities subject to our ads allow list.** Communities that have already opted not to appear in r/all won’t appear in the comment either, even if there is a discussion of this post there.
* **After today’s test, we will likely test this system with political ads.**

This test will be a success if there are a variety of posts and conversations about this post, even—and perhaps particularly—if they are critical.

## How we’re answering questions

r/announcements posts have an important difference from political ads: I treat them as AMAs and do my best to answer questions and respond to criticism (both of which I appreciate). With this approach, I expect doing so will be more difficult (at least this first time). However, the point of this test is not to make you hunt for our answers or for us to reply to fewer questions, and we don’t intend to use this approach for all our admin posts (e.g., in r/ModNews, r/changelog, r/ModSupport, and others, which are smaller subreddits that still work well).

For today, we’re going to make the first link of this post to r/ModNews and start by answering mods’ questions there. In a future announcement, we may ask a specific community if they would host us for the discussion that day (depending on what the announcement is) and set that as an official destination for discussion, like a regular AMA.

Additionally, I’ll do my best to find other places to respond, and we’ll maintain another comment below this post to list replies we’ve given outside of r/announcements so you can easily find our responses (which was a feature request from [our post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/g3r4xpm/) last week).

Ultimately, the goal of this test is to enable Reddit to do what Reddit does best: facilitate conversations (within the context of a community), provide commentary on political ads the way redditors already do on news and politics daily (sharing more information and calling bullshit in the comments when necessary), and extend the discussion well beyond the scope of the original post.

Thank you for participating. We hope this approach sets the stage for successful commentary not just today but down the road on political ads as well.

**Edit (9/28/20):** Update: After initial testing and a few small tweaks to the sorting and score display of the links in stickied comments like the one below, we’ll be using this discussion system on political ads moving forward. 

As I mentioned, our goal with this approach was to encourage these types of discussions to happen within the context of a community. While this feature is completely optional for communities (opt-out instructions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/)), we were pleased overall with the level of engagement that we saw from communities and users on this test post.

We’re still exploring how we’ll use this feature for r/announcements posts and how we can work with specific communities to have discussions about them.

Update to Our Content Policy,spez,21318,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/,38595,"[A few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/), we committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate. After talking extensively with mods, outside organizations, and our own teams, we’re updating our content policy today and enforcing it (with your help).

## First, a quick recap

Since our last post, here’s what we’ve been doing:

* **We brought on a** [**new Board member**](https://redditblog.com/2020/06/10/reddit-welcomes-michael-seibel-to-board-of-directors/).
* **We held policy calls with mods**—both from established Mod Councils and from communities disproportionately targeted with hate—and discussed areas where we can do better to action bad actors, clarify our policies, make mods' lives easier, and concretely reduce hate.
   * You can find [detailed notes from our All-Council mod call here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hi3nkr/the_mod_conversations_that_went_into_todays), including specific product work we discussed.
* **We developed our enforcement plan**, including both our immediate actions (e.g., today’s bans) and long-term investments (tackling the most critical work discussed in our mod calls, sustainably enforcing the new policies, and advancing Reddit’s community governance).

From our conversations with mods and outside experts, it’s clear that while we’ve gotten better in some areas—like actioning violations at the community level, [scaling enforcement efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/hbiuas/reddit_security_report_june_18_2020/), measurably reducing hateful experiences like harassment [year over year](https://www.adl.org/online-hate-2020#results)—we still have a long way to go to address the gaps in our policies and enforcement to date.

These include addressing questions our policies have left unanswered (like whether hate speech is allowed or even protected on Reddit), aspects of our product and mod tools that are still too easy for individual bad actors to abuse (inboxes, chats, modmail), and areas where we can do better to partner with our mods and communities who want to combat the same hateful conduct we do.

Ultimately, it’s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. In the near term, this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.

## New Policy

This is the [new content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). Here’s what’s different:

* It starts with a statement of our vision for Reddit and our communities, including the basic expectations we have for all communities and users.
* **Rule 1** explicitly states that communities and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.
   * There is an expanded definition of what constitutes a violation of this rule, along with specific examples, in our [Help Center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).
* **Rule 2** ties together our previous rules on prohibited behavior with an ask to abide by community rules and post with authentic, personal interest.
   * Debate and creativity are welcome, but spam and malicious attempts to interfere with other communities are not.
* The other rules are the same in spirit but have been rewritten for clarity and inclusiveness.

Alongside the change to the content policy, we are initially banning about 2000 subreddits, the vast majority of which are inactive. Of these communities, about [200](https://www.redditstatic.com/banned-subreddits-june-2020.txt) have more than 10 daily users. Both r/The_Donald and r/ChapoTrapHouse were included.

All communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so, despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1), antagonized us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8), and its mods have refused to meet our most basic expectations. Until now, we’ve worked in good faith to help them preserve the community as a space for its users—through warnings, mod changes, quarantining, and more.

Though smaller, r/ChapoTrapHouse was banned for similar reasons: They consistently host rule-breaking content and their mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.

To be clear, views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit—but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith, without exception.

## Our commitment

Our policies will never be perfect, with new edge cases that inevitably lead us to evolve them in the future. And as users, you will always have more context, community vernacular, and cultural values to inform the standards set within your communities than we as site admins or any AI ever could.

But just as our content moderation cannot scale effectively without your support, you need more support from us as well, and we admit we have fallen short towards this end. We are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors, abusive behaviors, and toxic communities that undermine our mission and get in the way of the creativity, discussions, and communities that bring us all to Reddit in the first place. We hope that our progress towards this commitment, with today’s update and those to come, makes Reddit a place you enjoy and are proud to be a part of for many years to come.

Edit: After digesting feedback, we made a clarifying change to our help center article for [Promoting Hate Based on Identity or Vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).",1593450006.0,Text
"Upcoming changes to our content policy, our board, and where we’re going from here",spez,40923,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/,40768,"**TL;DR: We’re working with mods to change our content policy to explicitly address hate.** u/kn0thing **has resigned from our board to fill his seat with a Black candidate, a request we will honor. I want to take responsibility for the history of our policies over the years that got us here, and we still have work to do.**

After watching people across the country mourn and demand an end to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people, I wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it, a duty to speak out.

Earlier this week, I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, “How can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?”

These questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy. 

Over the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities—across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could’ve imagined when we first created subreddits—and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.

However, as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:

* Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. 
* Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. 
* Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.

We are already working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it’s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.

We will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn’t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.

And just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he’s done for us over the years.

At the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.

In the early days of Reddit, 2005–2006, our idealistic “policy” was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our “policy.” 

I left Reddit from 2010–2015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit’s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). 

When I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what’s acceptable on Reddit and what’s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were “making Reddit worse” but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. 

While we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity—and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules, but also isn’t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.

This inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, “Breaking Reddit” was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.

The majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. 

Despite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.

I will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.

Announcing a ban on AI generated videos (with a few exceptions),ianjm,1854,https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1cg9nud/announcing_a_ban_on_ai_generated_videos_with_a/,279,"Howdy r/videos,

We all know the robots are coming for our jobs and our lives - but now they're coming for our subreddit too.

Multiple videos that have weird scripts that sound like they've come straight out of a kindergartener's thesaurus now regularly show up in the new queue, and all of them voiced by those same slightly off-putting set of cheap or free AI voice clones that everyone is using.

Not only are they annoying, but 99 times out of 100 they are also just bad videos, and, unfortunately, there is a very large overlap between the sorts of people who want to use AI to make their Youtube video, and the sorts of people who'll pay for a botnet to upvote it on Reddit.

So, starting today, we're proposing a full ban on low effort AI generated content. As mods we often already remove these, but we don't catch them all. You will soon be able to report both posts and comments as 'AI' and we'll remove them.

There will, however, be a few small exceptions. **All of which must have the new AI flair applied** (_which we will sort out in the coming couple days - a little flair housekeeping to do first_).

Some examples:

- Use of the tech in collaboration with a strong human element, e.g. creating a cartoon where AI has been used to help generate the video element based on a human-written script. 
- Demonstrations the progress of the technology (e.g. [Introducing Sora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK6y8DAPN_0))
- Satire that is actually funny (e.g. [satirical adverts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSewd6Iaj6I), deepfakes that are obvious and amusing) - though remember Rule 2, NO POLITICS
- Artistic pieces that aren't just crummy visualisers 

All of this will be up to the r/videos denizens, if we see an AI piece in the new queue that meets the above exceptions and is getting strongly upvoted, so long as is properly identified, it can stay.

The vast majority of AI videos we've seen so far though, do not.

Thanks, we hope this makes sense.

**Feedback welcome! If you have any suggestions about this policy, or just want to call the mods a bunch of assholes, now is your chance.**",1714422897.0,Text

""July the 14th, 1861

Washington D.C.

My very dear Sarah:

The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days—perhaps tomorrow. Lest I should not be able to write you again, I feel impelled to write lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more.

Our movement may be one of a few days duration and full of pleasure—and it may be one of severe conflict and death to me. Not my will, but thine O God, be done. If it is necessary that I should fall on the battlefield for my country, I am ready. I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in, the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how strongly American Civilization now leans upon the triumph of the Government, and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the Revolution. And I am willing—perfectly willing—to lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this Government, and to pay that debt.


But, my dear wife, when I know that with my own joys I lay down nearly all of yours, and replace them in this life with cares and sorrows—when, after having eaten for long years the bitter fruit of orphanage myself, I must offer it as their only sustenance to my dear little children—is it weak or dishonorable, while the banner of my purpose floats calmly and proudly in the breeze, that my unbounded love for you, my darling wife and children, should struggle in fierce, though useless, contest with my love of country.

Sarah, my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me to you with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break; and yet my love of Country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on with all these chains to the battlefield.

The memories of the blissful moments I have spent with you come creeping over me, and I feel most gratified to God and to you that I have enjoyed them so long. And hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years, when God willing, we might still have lived and loved together and seen our sons grow up to honorable manhood around us. I have, I know, but few and small claims upon Divine Providence, but something whispers to me—perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar—that I shall return to my loved ones unharmed. If I do not, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, and when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name.

Forgive my many faults, and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless and foolish I have often been! How gladly would I wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness, and struggle with all the misfortune of this world, to shield you and my children from harm. But I cannot. I must watch you from the spirit land and hover near you, while you buffet the storms with your precious little freight, and wait with sad patience till we meet to part no more.

But, O Sarah! If the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you; in the brightest day and in the darkest night—amidst your happiest scenes and gloomiest hours—always, always; and if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shall be my breath; or the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by.

Sarah, do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for thee, for we shall meet again.
As for my little boys, they will grow as I have done, and never know a father's love and care. Little Willie is too young to remember me long, and my blue-eyed Edgar will keep my frolics with him among the dimmest memories of his childhood. Sarah, I have unlimited confidence in your maternal care and your development of their characters. Tell my two mothers his and hers I call God's blessing upon them. O Sarah, I wait for you there! Come to me, and lead thither my children.

So was wondering what's other people's similar films that are one of their favourites but either less popular or just not as highly ranked as others.

Also would take any suggestions. Cancelled netflix cause it's a scam so looking for direction suggestions

Godzilla 2014 deserved better sequels.,maruhadapurpurine,262,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1d5yorj/godzilla_2014_deserved_better_sequels/,121,"I finally got around to watching those monsterverse movies this week and boy... how did they manage to peak right at the start?

The 2014 movie is so vastly above the sequels in tone and quality that it's hard to believe they belong in the same continuity. Godzilla 2014 is as grounded as a story about a giant lizard monster fighting other giant monsters can be. The human element is much simpler and easier to empathize with. The effects feel years ahead of what came after too. The destruction caused by the monsters fighting feel appropriately bleak while also being super awesome to watch.

I don't think any moment in the sequels ever got me nearly as hyped as when Godzilla shoots his atomic breath down the MUTO's throat. Hell even his first full appearance at Hawaii got me more hyped than anything in the sequels to be honest.

Yeah, I will be the first to agree that for a Godzilla movie there isn't nearly enough Godzilla in it, but maybe they were on to something by keeping his presence so brief until later. The sequels have monsters galore and they're no better for it.

The whole time watching King of the Monsters I was only ever mildly amused by all of it. Gidorah just looked goofy as fuck most of the time because it clashes so much with the semi realism that Godzilla was designed with. The human plot is absolutely awful and should have been cut down by a lot.

Godzilla vs Kong is alright... Sure the fight scenes are cool, but once again the human characters detract way more than add anything to it, especially the podcast guy and the kids. Why are they even here? The stranger things girl's story was over already, why is she back?

And the sci-fi shit was already too much last movie, in this one they just jump the shark completely. It's like they couldn't figure out how to keep the story going so the movies just got progressively dumber with each entry, like a kid mashing toys together. Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy a movie like that, but when you compare it with the 2014 movie it is just so disappointing to see such a major departure in direction. It's like they lost the plot.

Kong Skull Island was fun though. Nice twist to have Samual L Jackson as the villain. I would rank this one just below Godzilla 2014. Even if the tone between them is still completely different at least Skull Island managed to keep itself together by succeeding in the same areas that Godzilla did. Straightforward, centered plot, the human characters contribute to the story instead of detracting from it, great action scenes.

The only one left is Godzilla x Kong and I'm already not expecting anything aside some dumb but fun fight scenes, and just hoping the human characters are cut down to a minimum.

On a side note I also watched Shin Godzilla and will watch Godzilla Minus One as well. The take is so different you can't even really compare them. Shin Godzilla is much more of a political commentary on the japanese government than anything else. I guess that keeps the line much closer to the OG Godzilla movie.

Edit: I finished watching Minus One and GxK The New Empire so here are my brief thoughts.

Minus One: Obviously not related to the monsterverse but it pretty much nails the human element in a Godzilla movie. Even when you know where te story is going it still hits the emotional notes. Because of that I would say it is overall better than the 2014 version (though I would still say that 2014 has better hype moments. You just can't top that atomic breath straight down the MUTO's mouth.)

GxK: This movie is completely ridiculous in every way possible and it just cemented my thoughts on this. Regardless of what I think about the quality of the sequels, these movies absolutely shouldn't be in the same universe. The tone is too different, the world is simply not the same. There is no way you can watch GxK and then look at 2014 Godzilla and say they fit together. It just doesn't work. Again, I'm not against movies like this. They have an audience, and I can honestly say I had some fun watching it, but it should've been its own thing and not related to the 2014 movie, which in turn deserved a sequel much more in line with its tone and vision of the Godzilla universe.",1717281094.0,Text

Announcing a ban on AI generated videos (with a few exceptions),ianjm,1846,https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1cg9nud/announcing_a_ban_on_ai_generated_videos_with_a/,279,"Howdy r/videos,

We all know the robots are coming for our jobs and our lives - but now they're coming for our subreddit too.

Multiple videos that have weird scripts that sound like they've come straight out of a kindergartener's thesaurus now regularly show up in the new queue, and all of them voiced by those same slightly off-putting set of cheap or free AI voice clones that everyone is using.

Not only are they annoying, but 99 times out of 100 they are also just bad videos, and, unfortunately, there is a very large overlap between the sorts of people who want to use AI to make their Youtube video, and the sorts of people who'll pay for a botnet to upvote it on Reddit.

So, starting today, we're proposing a full ban on low effort AI generated content. As mods we often already remove these, but we don't catch them all. You will soon be able to report both posts and comments as 'AI' and we'll remove them.

There will, however, be a few small exceptions. **All of which must have the new AI flair applied** (_which we will sort out in the coming couple days - a little flair housekeeping to do first_).

Some examples:

- Use of the tech in collaboration with a strong human element, e.g. creating a cartoon where AI has been used to help generate the video element based on a human-written script. 
- Demonstrations the progress of the technology (e.g. [Introducing Sora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK6y8DAPN_0))
- Satire that is actually funny (e.g. [satirical adverts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSewd6Iaj6I), deepfakes that are obvious and amusing) - though remember Rule 2, NO POLITICS
- Artistic pieces that aren't just crummy visualisers 

All of this will be up to the r/videos denizens, if we see an AI piece in the new queue that meets the above exceptions and is getting strongly upvoted, so long as is properly identified, it can stay.

The vast majority of AI videos we've seen so far though, do not.

Thanks, we hope this makes sense.

**Feedback welcome! If you have any suggestions about this policy, or just want to call the mods a bunch of assholes, now is your chance.**",1714422897.0,Text

""July the 14th, 1861

Washington D.C.

My very dear Sarah:

The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days—perhaps tomorrow. Lest I should not be able to write you again, I feel impelled to write lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more.

Our movement may be one of a few days duration and full of pleasure—and it may be one of severe conflict and death to me. Not my will, but thine O God, be done. If it is necessary that I should fall on the battlefield for my country, I am ready. I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in, the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how strongly American Civilization now leans upon the triumph of the Government, and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the Revolution. And I am willing—perfectly willing—to lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this Government, and to pay that debt.


But, my dear wife, when I know that with my own joys I lay down nearly all of yours, and replace them in this life with cares and sorrows—when, after having eaten for long years the bitter fruit of orphanage myself, I must offer it as their only sustenance to my dear little children—is it weak or dishonorable, while the banner of my purpose floats calmly and proudly in the breeze, that my unbounded love for you, my darling wife and children, should struggle in fierce, though useless, contest with my love of country.

Sarah, my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me to you with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break; and yet my love of Country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on with all these chains to the battlefield.

The memories of the blissful moments I have spent with you come creeping over me, and I feel most gratified to God and to you that I have enjoyed them so long. And hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years, when God willing, we might still have lived and loved together and seen our sons grow up to honorable manhood around us. I have, I know, but few and small claims upon Divine Providence, but something whispers to me—perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar—that I shall return to my loved ones unharmed. If I do not, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, and when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name.

Forgive my many faults, and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless and foolish I have often been! How gladly would I wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness, and struggle with all the misfortune of this world, to shield you and my children from harm. But I cannot. I must watch you from the spirit land and hover near you, while you buffet the storms with your precious little freight, and wait with sad patience till we meet to part no more.

But, O Sarah! If the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you; in the brightest day and in the darkest night—amidst your happiest scenes and gloomiest hours—always, always; and if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shall be my breath; or the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by.

Sarah, do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for thee, for we shall meet again.
As for my little boys, they will grow as I have done, and never know a father's love and care. Little Willie is too young to remember me long, and my blue-eyed Edgar will keep my frolics with him among the dimmest memories of his childhood. Sarah, I have unlimited confidence in your maternal care and your development of their characters. Tell my two mothers his and hers I call God's blessing upon them. O Sarah, I wait for you there! Come to me, and lead thither my children.

"Debate, dissent, and protest on Reddit",spez,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/pbmy5y/debate_dissent_and_protest_on_reddit/,1,"Hey everyone–

The pandemic has been extremely hard on many of us. We believe the best way forward for everyone is to [get vaccinated](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) and continue to follow [CDC guidance on masking](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html). Throughout the pandemic, we have also provided COVID-related resources to support our volunteer moderators, users, and communities, including a dedicated AMA series connecting users with [authoritative experts on coronavirus](https://redditblog.com/2020/03/02/expert-conversation-on-coronavirus/) and [vaccines](https://redditblog.com/2021/01/28/introducing-a-new-reddit-ama-series-everything-you-want-to-know-about-covid-19-vaccines/), as well as deploying homepage and search page banners directing users to the CDC and r/Coronavirus.

We appreciate that not everyone agrees with the current approach to getting us all through the pandemic, and some are still wary of vaccinations. Dissent is a part of Reddit and the foundation of democracy. Reddit is a place for open and authentic discussion and debate. This includes conversations that question or disagree with popular consensus. This includes conversations that criticize those that disagree with the majority opinion. This includes protests that criticize or object to our decisions on which communities to ban from the platform.

While we appreciate the sentiment of those demanding that we ban more communities that challenge consensus views on the pandemic, we continue to believe in the good of our communities and hope that we collectively approach the challenges of the pandemic with empathy, compassion, and a willingness to understand what others are going through, even when their viewpoint on the pandemic is different from yours. 

When it comes to COVID-19 specifically, what we know and what are the current best practices from authoritative sources, like the CDC, evolve continuously with new learnings. Given the rapid state of change, we believe it is best to enable communities to engage in debate and dissent, and for us to link to the CDC wherever appropriate. While we believe the CDC is the best and most up to date source of information regarding COVID-19, disagreeing with them is not against our policies.

However, manipulating or cheating Reddit to amplify any particular viewpoint is against our policies, and we will continue to action communities that do so or that violate any of our other rules, including those dedicated to fraud (e.g. fake vaccine cards) or encouraging harm (e.g. consuming bleach); and we will continue to use our quarantine tool to link to authoritative sources and warn people they may encounter unsound advice. We humbly ask and encourage everyone to report content that may violate our policies.

We’re hopeful that spirit will continue in the future. 

**What this means for future exchanges in 2021**

In preparation for retiring Reddit Gifts after the final exchange at the end of 2021, we will be taking the following actions: 

* In order to limit incomplete exchanges, we have disabled the creation of any new Reddit Gifts accounts. If you have an existing Reddit Gifts account, we would love it if you would participate with us in these final exchanges. 
* Any incomplete exchanges will result in a ban from the remaining Reddit Gifts exchanges.
* This morning, we turned off the ability to buy [Elves](https://www.redditgifts.com/Elves/). If you purchased an Elves membership and have remaining months after the 2021 Secret Santa Exchange, we will email you about your refund options then. If you have specific concerns about your Elves membership, please reach out to Reddit Gifts [support](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000825092). 

These changes have been put in place to ensure that these last exchanges are enjoyable for the legacy Reddit Gifts users. We want to celebrate the end of Reddit Gifts with the community that we’ve built so far. 

Countless acts of love, heroism, compassion, support, growth and hilarity happened through Reddit Gifts, and those memories will live on in the hearts of our community.

As of today, the employee in question is no longer employed by Reddit. We built a relationship with her first as a mod and then through her contractor work on RPAN. We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her. 

We’ve put significant effort into improving how we handle doxxing and harassment, and this employee was the subject of both. In this case, we over-indexed on protection, which had serious consequences in terms of enforcement actions. 

* On March 9th, we added extra protections for this employee, including actioning content that mentioned the employee’s name or shared personal information on third-party sites, which we reserve for serious cases of harassment and doxxing.
* On March 22nd, a news article about this employee was posted by a mod of r/ukpolitics. The article was removed and the submitter banned by the aforementioned rules. When contacted by the moderators of r/ukpolitics, we reviewed the actions, and reversed the ban on the moderator, and we informed the r/ukpolitics moderation team that we had restored the mod.

Today we’re testing a new way to discuss political ads (and announcements),spez,17311,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/ipitt0/today_were_testing_a_new_way_to_discuss_political/,2,"In case you missed [the](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/ikxsst/this_reddit_billboard_advertisement_for_their/) [billboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ilhck2/saw_one_in_the_wild_make_sure_to_vote_illinois/), [blog posts](https://redditblog.com/2020/09/01/its-national-poll-worker-recruitment-day-become-a-poll-worker-this-election-and-help-power-the-polls-in-your-community/), and [AMAs](https://redditblog.com/2020/08/25/voting-in-america/), we’re doing our best to encourage people on and off Reddit to vote this year. Along with our [Up the Vote campaign](https://redditblog.com/2020/07/29/up-the-vote-reddits-irl-2020-voting-campaign/) and [ongoing security and safety work](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/) to guard against shenanigans, we’ve also been evolving how we handle another important aspect of the election process: **political ads**.

## First, some background

Political ads have been a relatively quiet part of Reddit for many years. Last year, in thinking through what the right balance was between unfettered political ads and prohibiting them altogether for 2020 (both approaches that other platforms have taken), we decided on [a policy we felt was the best approach for Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/g0s6tn/changes_to_reddits_political_ads_policy/): no misinformation, human review of the ads and where they link, a subreddit listing all political ads ([r/RedditPoliticalAds](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditPoliticalAds/)), and a requirement to keep comments on for 24 hours.

Since debuting this policy earlier this year, the last condition (requiring comments to remain on) has enabled redditors to discuss political ads—providing more context in the comments and even offering counterarguments—but so far it’s only been lightly used. As we get closer to November, however, the prominence of and discussion around political ads will increase, and, with it, the need for a clear moderation system for these comments.

## The problem we’re addressing

As I mentioned [a couple months back](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/fwdxoty/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3&depth=2), unmoderated spaces on Reddit are an area we want to improve, from Modmail to PM’s, and political ads pose a unique challenge.

If the OP of a political ad (i.e., a campaign) moderates the comments, it’s problematic: they might remove dissenting perspectives. And if we (the admins) moderate the comments of a political ad, it’s even more problematic, putting us in the position of either moderating too much or too little, with inevitable accusations of bias either way.

The problem, we realized, is similar to what we see in r/announcements: lots of people commenting on a highly visible post outside the context of a community. It’s fair to say that r/announcements isn’t really a community; it lacks the culture, cohesion, and moderation that benefit most other subreddits, and as a result, the quality of conversation has deteriorated as the audience has grown.

Ultimately, conversations really only happen in the context of a community, and neither r/announcements nor political ads with comments on provide this. We believe we can foster better discussion on both with a different approach.

## What we’re testing today

Instead of having the usual free-for-all of comments on the r/announcements post itself, we are trying out a new experience today that encourages discussion of this post within other communities—an approach we hope works for political ads as well.

Below is a stickied comment with a link to submit this post to other communities on Reddit and a list of those discussion posts. The stickied comment will update automatically with new posts.

A few other details to note for this test:

* **The discussion posts are like any other post**, which means they can be voted on by users and removed by mods.
* **Communities that don’t want to participate don’t have to.** (If you’re a mod of a community where a user attempts to crosspost this, you will get a Modmail alerting you to this with [opt-out instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/).)
* **Individual community rules apply to these posts just as any other**, so read the rules before attempting to bring the discussion into a completely unrelated community.
* **Our stickied comment will link to discussions only from communities subject to our ads allow list.** Communities that have already opted not to appear in r/all won’t appear in the comment either, even if there is a discussion of this post there.
* **After today’s test, we will likely test this system with political ads.**

This test will be a success if there are a variety of posts and conversations about this post, even—and perhaps particularly—if they are critical.

## How we’re answering questions

r/announcements posts have an important difference from political ads: I treat them as AMAs and do my best to answer questions and respond to criticism (both of which I appreciate). With this approach, I expect doing so will be more difficult (at least this first time). However, the point of this test is not to make you hunt for our answers or for us to reply to fewer questions, and we don’t intend to use this approach for all our admin posts (e.g., in r/ModNews, r/changelog, r/ModSupport, and others, which are smaller subreddits that still work well).

For today, we’re going to make the first link of this post to r/ModNews and start by answering mods’ questions there. In a future announcement, we may ask a specific community if they would host us for the discussion that day (depending on what the announcement is) and set that as an official destination for discussion, like a regular AMA.

Additionally, I’ll do my best to find other places to respond, and we’ll maintain another comment below this post to list replies we’ve given outside of r/announcements so you can easily find our responses (which was a feature request from [our post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/g3r4xpm/) last week).

Ultimately, the goal of this test is to enable Reddit to do what Reddit does best: facilitate conversations (within the context of a community), provide commentary on political ads the way redditors already do on news and politics daily (sharing more information and calling bullshit in the comments when necessary), and extend the discussion well beyond the scope of the original post.

Thank you for participating. We hope this approach sets the stage for successful commentary not just today but down the road on political ads as well.

**Edit (9/28/20):** Update: After initial testing and a few small tweaks to the sorting and score display of the links in stickied comments like the one below, we’ll be using this discussion system on political ads moving forward. 

As I mentioned, our goal with this approach was to encourage these types of discussions to happen within the context of a community. While this feature is completely optional for communities (opt-out instructions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/)), we were pleased overall with the level of engagement that we saw from communities and users on this test post.

We’re still exploring how we’ll use this feature for r/announcements posts and how we can work with specific communities to have discussions about them. In the meantime, you can see our updated political ads policy on our [Advertising Policy Help Page](https://advertising.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-advertising-policy/reddit-advertising-policy-overview).",1599667576.0,Text

Update to Our Content Policy,spez,21319,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/,38595,"[A few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/), we committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate. After talking extensively with mods, outside organizations, and our own teams, we’re updating our content policy today and enforcing it (with your help).

## First, a quick recap

Since our last post, here’s what we’ve been doing:

* **We brought on a** [**new Board member**](https://redditblog.com/2020/06/10/reddit-welcomes-michael-seibel-to-board-of-directors/).
* **We held policy calls with mods**—both from established Mod Councils and from communities disproportionately targeted with hate—and discussed areas where we can do better to action bad actors, clarify our policies, make mods' lives easier, and concretely reduce hate.
   * You can find [detailed notes from our All-Council mod call here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hi3nkr/the_mod_conversations_that_went_into_todays), including specific product work we discussed.
* **We developed our enforcement plan**, including both our immediate actions (e.g., today’s bans) and long-term investments (tackling the most critical work discussed in our mod calls, sustainably enforcing the new policies, and advancing Reddit’s community governance).

From our conversations with mods and outside experts, it’s clear that while we’ve gotten better in some areas—like actioning violations at the community level, [scaling enforcement efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/hbiuas/reddit_security_report_june_18_2020/), measurably reducing hateful experiences like harassment [year over year](https://www.adl.org/online-hate-2020#results)—we still have a long way to go to address the gaps in our policies and enforcement to date.

These include addressing questions our policies have left unanswered (like whether hate speech is allowed or even protected on Reddit), aspects of our product and mod tools that are still too easy for individual bad actors to abuse (inboxes, chats, modmail), and areas where we can do better to partner with our mods and communities who want to combat the same hateful conduct we do.

Ultimately, it’s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. In the near term, this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.

## New Policy

This is the [new content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). Here’s what’s different:

* It starts with a statement of our vision for Reddit and our communities, including the basic expectations we have for all communities and users.
* **Rule 1** explicitly states that communities and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.
   * There is an expanded definition of what constitutes a violation of this rule, along with specific examples, in our [Help Center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).
* **Rule 2** ties together our previous rules on prohibited behavior with an ask to abide by community rules and post with authentic, personal interest.
   * Debate and creativity are welcome, but spam and malicious attempts to interfere with other communities are not.
* The other rules are the same in spirit but have been rewritten for clarity and inclusiveness.

Alongside the change to the content policy, we are initially banning about 2000 subreddits, the vast majority of which are inactive. Of these communities, about [200](https://www.redditstatic.com/banned-subreddits-june-2020.txt) have more than 10 daily users. Both r/The_Donald and r/ChapoTrapHouse were included.

All communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so, despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1), antagonized us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8), and its mods have refused to meet our most basic expectations. Until now, we’ve worked in good faith to help them preserve the community as a space for its users—through warnings, mod changes, quarantining, and more.

Though smaller, r/ChapoTrapHouse was banned for similar reasons: They consistently host rule-breaking content and their mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.

To be clear, views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit—but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith, without exception.

## Our commitment

Our policies will never be perfect, with new edge cases that inevitably lead us to evolve them in the future. And as users, you will always have more context, community vernacular, and cultural values to inform the standards set within your communities than we as site admins or any AI ever could.

But just as our content moderation cannot scale effectively without your support, you need more support from us as well, and we admit we have fallen short towards this end. We are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors, abusive behaviors, and toxic communities that undermine our mission and get in the way of the creativity, discussions, and communities that bring us all to Reddit in the first place. We hope that our progress towards this commitment, with today’s update and those to come, makes Reddit a place you enjoy and are proud to be a part of for many years to come.

Edit: After digesting feedback, we made a clarifying change to our help center article for [Promoting Hate Based on Identity or Vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).",1593450006.0,Text
"Upcoming changes to our content policy, our board, and where we’re going from here",spez,40927,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/,40768,"**TL;DR: We’re working with mods to change our content policy to explicitly address hate.** u/kn0thing **has resigned from our board to fill his seat with a Black candidate, a request we will honor. I want to take responsibility for the history of our policies over the years that got us here, and we still have work to do.**

After watching people across the country mourn and demand an end to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people, I wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it, a duty to speak out.

Earlier this week, I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, “How can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?”

These questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy. 

Over the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities—across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could’ve imagined when we first created subreddits—and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.

However, as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:

* Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. 
* Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. 
* Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.

We are already working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it’s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.

We will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn’t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.

And just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he’s done for us over the years.

At the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.

In the early days of Reddit, 2005–2006, our idealistic “policy” was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our “policy.” 

I left Reddit from 2010–2015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit’s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). 

When I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what’s acceptable on Reddit and what’s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were “making Reddit worse” but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. 

While we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity—and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules, but also isn’t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.

This inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, “Breaking Reddit” was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.

The majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. 

Despite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.

I will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.

The pandemic has been extremely hard on many of us. We believe the best way forward for everyone is to [get vaccinated](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) and continue to follow [CDC guidance on masking](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html). Throughout the pandemic, we have also provided COVID-related resources to support our volunteer moderators, users, and communities, including a dedicated AMA series connecting users with [authoritative experts on coronavirus](https://redditblog.com/2020/03/02/expert-conversation-on-coronavirus/) and [vaccines](https://redditblog.com/2021/01/28/introducing-a-new-reddit-ama-series-everything-you-want-to-know-about-covid-19-vaccines/), as well as deploying homepage and search page banners directing users to the CDC and r/Coronavirus.

We appreciate that not everyone agrees with the current approach to getting us all through the pandemic, and some are still wary of vaccinations. Dissent is a part of Reddit and the foundation of democracy. Reddit is a place for open and authentic discussion and debate. This includes conversations that question or disagree with popular consensus. This includes conversations that criticize those that disagree with the majority opinion. This includes protests that criticize or object to our decisions on which communities to ban from the platform.

While we appreciate the sentiment of those demanding that we ban more communities that challenge consensus views on the pandemic, we continue to believe in the good of our communities and hope that we collectively approach the challenges of the pandemic with empathy, compassion, and a willingness to understand what others are going through, even when their viewpoint on the pandemic is different from yours. 

When it comes to COVID-19 specifically, what we know and what are the current best practices from authoritative sources, like the CDC, evolve continuously with new learnings. Given the rapid state of change, we believe it is best to enable communities to engage in debate and dissent, and for us to link to the CDC wherever appropriate. While we believe the CDC is the best and most up to date source of information regarding COVID-19, disagreeing with them is not against our policies.

However, manipulating or cheating Reddit to amplify any particular viewpoint is against our policies, and we will continue to action communities that do so or that violate any of our other rules, including those dedicated to fraud (e.g. fake vaccine cards) or encouraging harm (e.g. consuming bleach); and we will continue to use our quarantine tool to link to authoritative sources and warn people they may encounter unsound advice. We humbly ask and encourage everyone to report content that may violate our policies.

**What this means for future exchanges in 2021**

In preparation for retiring Reddit Gifts after the final exchange at the end of 2021, we will be taking the following actions: 

* In order to limit incomplete exchanges, we have disabled the creation of any new Reddit Gifts accounts. If you have an existing Reddit Gifts account, we would love it if you would participate with us in these final exchanges. 
* Any incomplete exchanges will result in a ban from the remaining Reddit Gifts exchanges.
* This morning, we turned off the ability to buy [Elves](https://www.redditgifts.com/Elves/). If you purchased an Elves membership and have remaining months after the 2021 Secret Santa Exchange, we will email you about your refund options then. If you have specific concerns about your Elves membership, please reach out to Reddit Gifts [support](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000825092). 

These changes have been put in place to ensure that these last exchanges are enjoyable for the legacy Reddit Gifts users. We want to celebrate the end of Reddit Gifts with the community that we’ve built so far. 

Countless acts of love, heroism, compassion, support, growth and hilarity happened through Reddit Gifts, and those memories will live on in the hearts of our community.

As of today, the employee in question is no longer employed by Reddit. We built a relationship with her first as a mod and then through her contractor work on RPAN. We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her. 

We’ve put significant effort into improving how we handle doxxing and harassment, and this employee was the subject of both. In this case, we over-indexed on protection, which had serious consequences in terms of enforcement actions. 

* On March 9th, we added extra protections for this employee, including actioning content that mentioned the employee’s name or shared personal information on third-party sites, which we reserve for serious cases of harassment and doxxing.
* On March 22nd, a news article about this employee was posted by a mod of r/ukpolitics. The article was removed and the submitter banned by the aforementioned rules. When contacted by the moderators of r/ukpolitics, we reviewed the actions, and reversed the ban on the moderator, and we informed the r/ukpolitics moderation team that we had restored the mod.

Today we’re testing a new way to discuss political ads (and announcements),spez,17313,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/ipitt0/today_were_testing_a_new_way_to_discuss_political/,2,"In case you missed [the](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/ikxsst/this_reddit_billboard_advertisement_for_their/) [billboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ilhck2/saw_one_in_the_wild_make_sure_to_vote_illinois/), [blog posts](https://redditblog.com/2020/09/01/its-national-poll-worker-recruitment-day-become-a-poll-worker-this-election-and-help-power-the-polls-in-your-community/), and [AMAs](https://redditblog.com/2020/08/25/voting-in-america/), we’re doing our best to encourage people on and off Reddit to vote this year. Along with our [Up the Vote campaign](https://redditblog.com/2020/07/29/up-the-vote-reddits-irl-2020-voting-campaign/) and [ongoing security and safety work](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/) to guard against shenanigans, we’ve also been evolving how we handle another important aspect of the election process: **political ads**.

## First, some background

Political ads have been a relatively quiet part of Reddit for many years. Last year, in thinking through what the right balance was between unfettered political ads and prohibiting them altogether for 2020 (both approaches that other platforms have taken), we decided on [a policy we felt was the best approach for Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/g0s6tn/changes_to_reddits_political_ads_policy/): no misinformation, human review of the ads and where they link, a subreddit listing all political ads ([r/RedditPoliticalAds](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditPoliticalAds/)), and a requirement to keep comments on for 24 hours.

Since debuting this policy earlier this year, the last condition (requiring comments to remain on) has enabled redditors to discuss political ads—providing more context in the comments and even offering counterarguments—but so far it’s only been lightly used. As we get closer to November, however, the prominence of and discussion around political ads will increase, and, with it, the need for a clear moderation system for these comments.

## The problem we’re addressing

As I mentioned [a couple months back](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/fwdxoty/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3&depth=2), unmoderated spaces on Reddit are an area we want to improve, from Modmail to PM’s, and political ads pose a unique challenge.

If the OP of a political ad (i.e., a campaign) moderates the comments, it’s problematic: they might remove dissenting perspectives. And if we (the admins) moderate the comments of a political ad, it’s even more problematic, putting us in the position of either moderating too much or too little, with inevitable accusations of bias either way.

The problem, we realized, is similar to what we see in r/announcements: lots of people commenting on a highly visible post outside the context of a community. It’s fair to say that r/announcements isn’t really a community; it lacks the culture, cohesion, and moderation that benefit most other subreddits, and as a result, the quality of conversation has deteriorated as the audience has grown.

Ultimately, conversations really only happen in the context of a community, and neither r/announcements nor political ads with comments on provide this. We believe we can foster better discussion on both with a different approach.

## What we’re testing today

Instead of having the usual free-for-all of comments on the r/announcements post itself, we are trying out a new experience today that encourages discussion of this post within other communities—an approach we hope works for political ads as well.

Below is a stickied comment with a link to submit this post to other communities on Reddit and a list of those discussion posts. The stickied comment will update automatically with new posts.

A few other details to note for this test:

* **The discussion posts are like any other post**, which means they can be voted on by users and removed by mods.
* **Communities that don’t want to participate don’t have to.** (If you’re a mod of a community where a user attempts to crosspost this, you will get a Modmail alerting you to this with [opt-out instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/).)
* **Individual community rules apply to these posts just as any other**, so read the rules before attempting to bring the discussion into a completely unrelated community.
* **Our stickied comment will link to discussions only from communities subject to our ads allow list.** Communities that have already opted not to appear in r/all won’t appear in the comment either, even if there is a discussion of this post there.
* **After today’s test, we will likely test this system with political ads.**

This test will be a success if there are a variety of posts and conversations about this post, even—and perhaps particularly—if they are critical.

## How we’re answering questions

r/announcements posts have an important difference from political ads: I treat them as AMAs and do my best to answer questions and respond to criticism (both of which I appreciate). With this approach, I expect doing so will be more difficult (at least this first time). However, the point of this test is not to make you hunt for our answers or for us to reply to fewer questions, and we don’t intend to use this approach for all our admin posts (e.g., in r/ModNews, r/changelog, r/ModSupport, and others, which are smaller subreddits that still work well).

For today, we’re going to make the first link of this post to r/ModNews and start by answering mods’ questions there. In a future announcement, we may ask a specific community if they would host us for the discussion that day (depending on what the announcement is) and set that as an official destination for discussion, like a regular AMA.

Additionally, I’ll do my best to find other places to respond, and we’ll maintain another comment below this post to list replies we’ve given outside of r/announcements so you can easily find our responses (which was a feature request from [our post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/g3r4xpm/) last week).

Ultimately, the goal of this test is to enable Reddit to do what Reddit does best: facilitate conversations (within the context of a community), provide commentary on political ads the way redditors already do on news and politics daily (sharing more information and calling bullshit in the comments when necessary), and extend the discussion well beyond the scope of the original post.

Thank you for participating. We hope this approach sets the stage for successful commentary not just today but down the road on political ads as well.

**Edit (9/28/20):** Update: After initial testing and a few small tweaks to the sorting and score display of the links in stickied comments like the one below, we’ll be using this discussion system on political ads moving forward. 

As I mentioned, our goal with this approach was to encourage these types of discussions to happen within the context of a community. While this feature is completely optional for communities (opt-out instructions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/)), we were pleased overall with the level of engagement that we saw from communities and users on this test post.

We’re still exploring how we’ll use this feature for r/announcements posts and how we can work with specific communities to have discussions about them. In the meantime, you can see our updated political ads policy on our [Advertising Policy Help Page](https://advertising.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-advertising-policy/reddit-advertising-policy-overview).",1599667576.0,Text

Update to Our Content Policy,spez,21323,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/,38595,"[A few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/), we committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate. After talking extensively with mods, outside organizations, and our own teams, we’re updating our content policy today and enforcing it (with your help).

## First, a quick recap

Since our last post, here’s what we’ve been doing:

* **We brought on a** [**new Board member**](https://redditblog.com/2020/06/10/reddit-welcomes-michael-seibel-to-board-of-directors/).
* **We held policy calls with mods**—both from established Mod Councils and from communities disproportionately targeted with hate—and discussed areas where we can do better to action bad actors, clarify our policies, make mods' lives easier, and concretely reduce hate.
   * You can find [detailed notes from our All-Council mod call here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hi3nkr/the_mod_conversations_that_went_into_todays), including specific product work we discussed.
* **We developed our enforcement plan**, including both our immediate actions (e.g., today’s bans) and long-term investments (tackling the most critical work discussed in our mod calls, sustainably enforcing the new policies, and advancing Reddit’s community governance).

From our conversations with mods and outside experts, it’s clear that while we’ve gotten better in some areas—like actioning violations at the community level, [scaling enforcement efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/hbiuas/reddit_security_report_june_18_2020/), measurably reducing hateful experiences like harassment [year over year](https://www.adl.org/online-hate-2020#results)—we still have a long way to go to address the gaps in our policies and enforcement to date.

These include addressing questions our policies have left unanswered (like whether hate speech is allowed or even protected on Reddit), aspects of our product and mod tools that are still too easy for individual bad actors to abuse (inboxes, chats, modmail), and areas where we can do better to partner with our mods and communities who want to combat the same hateful conduct we do.

Ultimately, it’s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. In the near term, this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.

## New Policy

This is the [new content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). Here’s what’s different:

* It starts with a statement of our vision for Reddit and our communities, including the basic expectations we have for all communities and users.
* **Rule 1** explicitly states that communities and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.
   * There is an expanded definition of what constitutes a violation of this rule, along with specific examples, in our [Help Center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).
* **Rule 2** ties together our previous rules on prohibited behavior with an ask to abide by community rules and post with authentic, personal interest.
   * Debate and creativity are welcome, but spam and malicious attempts to interfere with other communities are not.
* The other rules are the same in spirit but have been rewritten for clarity and inclusiveness.

Alongside the change to the content policy, we are initially banning about 2000 subreddits, the vast majority of which are inactive. Of these communities, about [200](https://www.redditstatic.com/banned-subreddits-june-2020.txt) have more than 10 daily users. Both r/The_Donald and r/ChapoTrapHouse were included.

All communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so, despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1), antagonized us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8), and its mods have refused to meet our most basic expectations. Until now, we’ve worked in good faith to help them preserve the community as a space for its users—through warnings, mod changes, quarantining, and more.

Though smaller, r/ChapoTrapHouse was banned for similar reasons: They consistently host rule-breaking content and their mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.

To be clear, views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit—but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith, without exception.

## Our commitment

Our policies will never be perfect, with new edge cases that inevitably lead us to evolve them in the future. And as users, you will always have more context, community vernacular, and cultural values to inform the standards set within your communities than we as site admins or any AI ever could.

But just as our content moderation cannot scale effectively without your support, you need more support from us as well, and we admit we have fallen short towards this end. We are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors, abusive behaviors, and toxic communities that undermine our mission and get in the way of the creativity, discussions, and communities that bring us all to Reddit in the first place. We hope that our progress towards this commitment, with today’s update and those to come, makes Reddit a place you enjoy and are proud to be a part of for many years to come.

Edit: After digesting feedback, we made a clarifying change to our help center article for [Promoting Hate Based on Identity or Vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).",1593450006.0,Text
"Upcoming changes to our content policy, our board, and where we’re going from here",spez,40921,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/,40768,"**TL;DR: We’re working with mods to change our content policy to explicitly address hate.** u/kn0thing **has resigned from our board to fill his seat with a Black candidate, a request we will honor. I want to take responsibility for the history of our policies over the years that got us here, and we still have work to do.**

After watching people across the country mourn and demand an end to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people, I wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it, a duty to speak out.

Earlier this week, I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, “How can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?”

These questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy. 

Over the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities—across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could’ve imagined when we first created subreddits—and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.

However, as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:

* Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. 
* Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. 
* Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.

We are already working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it’s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.

We will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn’t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.

And just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he’s done for us over the years.

At the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.

In the early days of Reddit, 2005–2006, our idealistic “policy” was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our “policy.” 

I left Reddit from 2010–2015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit’s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). 

When I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what’s acceptable on Reddit and what’s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were “making Reddit worse” but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. 

While we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity—and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules, but also isn’t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.

This inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, “Breaking Reddit” was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.

The majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. 

Despite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.

I will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.

Thanks,

Godzilla 2014 deserved better sequels.,maruhadapurpurine,263,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1d5yorj/godzilla_2014_deserved_better_sequels/,121,"I finally got around to watching those monsterverse movies this week and boy... how did they manage to peak right at the start?

The 2014 movie is so vastly above the sequels in tone and quality that it's hard to believe they belong in the same continuity. Godzilla 2014 is as grounded as a story about a giant lizard monster fighting other giant monsters can be. The human element is much simpler and easier to empathize with. The effects feel years ahead of what came after too. The destruction caused by the monsters fighting feel appropriately bleak while also being super awesome to watch.

I don't think any moment in the sequels ever got me nearly as hyped as when Godzilla shoots his atomic breath down the MUTO's throat. Hell even his first full appearance at Hawaii got me more hyped than anything in the sequels to be honest.

Yeah, I will be the first to agree that for a Godzilla movie there isn't nearly enough Godzilla in it, but maybe they were on to something by keeping his presence so brief until later. The sequels have monsters galore and they're no better for it.

The whole time watching King of the Monsters I was only ever mildly amused by all of it. Gidorah just looked goofy as fuck most of the time because it clashes so much with the semi realism that Godzilla was designed with. The human plot is absolutely awful and should have been cut down by a lot.

Godzilla vs Kong is alright... Sure the fight scenes are cool, but once again the human characters detract way more than add anything to it, especially the podcast guy and the kids. Why are they even here? The stranger things girl's story was over already, why is she back?

And the sci-fi shit was already too much last movie, in this one they just jump the shark completely. It's like they couldn't figure out how to keep the story going so the movies just got progressively dumber with each entry, like a kid mashing toys together. Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy a movie like that, but when you compare it with the 2014 movie it is just so disappointing to see such a major departure in direction. It's like they lost the plot.

Kong Skull Island was fun though. Nice twist to have Samual L Jackson as the villain. I would rank this one just below Godzilla 2014. Even if the tone between them is still completely different at least Skull Island managed to keep itself together by succeeding in the same areas that Godzilla did. Straightforward, centered plot, the human characters contribute to the story instead of detracting from it, great action scenes.

The only one left is Godzilla x Kong and I'm already not expecting anything aside some dumb but fun fight scenes, and just hoping the human characters are cut down to a minimum.

On a side note I also watched Shin Godzilla and will watch Godzilla Minus One as well. The take is so different you can't even really compare them. Shin Godzilla is much more of a political commentary on the japanese government than anything else. I guess that keeps the line much closer to the OG Godzilla movie.

Edit: I finished watching Minus One and GxK The New Empire so here are my brief thoughts.

Minus One: Obviously not related to the monsterverse but it pretty much nails the human element in a Godzilla movie. Even when you know where te story is going it still hits the emotional notes. Because of that I would say it is overall better than the 2014 version (though I would still say that 2014 has better hype moments. You just can't top that atomic breath straight down the MUTO's mouth.)

GxK: This movie is completely ridiculous in every way possible and it just cemented my thoughts on this. Regardless of what I think about the quality of the sequels, these movies absolutely shouldn't be in the same universe. The tone is too different, the world is simply not the same. There is no way you can watch GxK and then look at 2014 Godzilla and say they fit together. It just doesn't work. Again, I'm not against movies like this. They have an audience, and I can honestly say I had some fun watching it, but it should've been its own thing and not related to the 2014 movie, which in turn deserved a sequel much more in line with its tone and vision of the Godzilla universe.",1717281094.0,Text

Or maybe the female lead is like ""hell no, your not doing that to my hair!!' The best they will do is put on some dumb wig on a male actor or for a female actor just tease the ends a bit.

Announcing a ban on AI generated videos (with a few exceptions),ianjm,1848,https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1cg9nud/announcing_a_ban_on_ai_generated_videos_with_a/,279,"Howdy r/videos,

We all know the robots are coming for our jobs and our lives - but now they're coming for our subreddit too.

Multiple videos that have weird scripts that sound like they've come straight out of a kindergartener's thesaurus now regularly show up in the new queue, and all of them voiced by those same slightly off-putting set of cheap or free AI voice clones that everyone is using.

Not only are they annoying, but 99 times out of 100 they are also just bad videos, and, unfortunately, there is a very large overlap between the sorts of people who want to use AI to make their Youtube video, and the sorts of people who'll pay for a botnet to upvote it on Reddit.

So, starting today, we're proposing a full ban on low effort AI generated content. As mods we often already remove these, but we don't catch them all. You will soon be able to report both posts and comments as 'AI' and we'll remove them.

There will, however, be a few small exceptions. **All of which must have the new AI flair applied** (_which we will sort out in the coming couple days - a little flair housekeeping to do first_).

Some examples:

- Use of the tech in collaboration with a strong human element, e.g. creating a cartoon where AI has been used to help generate the video element based on a human-written script. 
- Demonstrations the progress of the technology (e.g. [Introducing Sora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK6y8DAPN_0))
- Satire that is actually funny (e.g. [satirical adverts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSewd6Iaj6I), deepfakes that are obvious and amusing) - though remember Rule 2, NO POLITICS
- Artistic pieces that aren't just crummy visualisers 

All of this will be up to the r/videos denizens, if we see an AI piece in the new queue that meets the above exceptions and is getting strongly upvoted, so long as is properly identified, it can stay.

The vast majority of AI videos we've seen so far though, do not.

Thanks, we hope this makes sense.

**Feedback welcome! If you have any suggestions about this policy, or just want to call the mods a bunch of assholes, now is your chance.**",1714422897.0,Text

""July the 14th, 1861

Washington D.C.

My very dear Sarah:

The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days—perhaps tomorrow. Lest I should not be able to write you again, I feel impelled to write lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more.

Our movement may be one of a few days duration and full of pleasure—and it may be one of severe conflict and death to me. Not my will, but thine O God, be done. If it is necessary that I should fall on the battlefield for my country, I am ready. I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in, the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how strongly American Civilization now leans upon the triumph of the Government, and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the Revolution. And I am willing—perfectly willing—to lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this Government, and to pay that debt.


But, my dear wife, when I know that with my own joys I lay down nearly all of yours, and replace them in this life with cares and sorrows—when, after having eaten for long years the bitter fruit of orphanage myself, I must offer it as their only sustenance to my dear little children—is it weak or dishonorable, while the banner of my purpose floats calmly and proudly in the breeze, that my unbounded love for you, my darling wife and children, should struggle in fierce, though useless, contest with my love of country.

Sarah, my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me to you with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break; and yet my love of Country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on with all these chains to the battlefield.

The memories of the blissful moments I have spent with you come creeping over me, and I feel most gratified to God and to you that I have enjoyed them so long. And hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years, when God willing, we might still have lived and loved together and seen our sons grow up to honorable manhood around us. I have, I know, but few and small claims upon Divine Providence, but something whispers to me—perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar—that I shall return to my loved ones unharmed. If I do not, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, and when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name.

Forgive my many faults, and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless and foolish I have often been! How gladly would I wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness, and struggle with all the misfortune of this world, to shield you and my children from harm. But I cannot. I must watch you from the spirit land and hover near you, while you buffet the storms with your precious little freight, and wait with sad patience till we meet to part no more.

But, O Sarah! If the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you; in the brightest day and in the darkest night—amidst your happiest scenes and gloomiest hours—always, always; and if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shall be my breath; or the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by.

Sarah, do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for thee, for we shall meet again.
As for my little boys, they will grow as I have done, and never know a father's love and care. Little Willie is too young to remember me long, and my blue-eyed Edgar will keep my frolics with him among the dimmest memories of his childhood. Sarah, I have unlimited confidence in your maternal care and your development of their characters. Tell my two mothers his and hers I call God's blessing upon them. O Sarah, I wait for you there! Come to me, and lead thither my children.

Forging A Return to Productive Conversation: An Open Letter to Reddit,Funny_Sentinel,1196,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/14jmh7e/forging_a_return_to_productive_conversation_an/,1,"To All Whom It May Concern:

For fifteen years, /r/Funny has been one of Reddit’s most-popular communities. That time hasn’t been without its difficulties, but for the most part, we’ve all gotten along (with each other and with administrators). Members of our team fondly remember Moderator Roadshows, visits to Reddit’s headquarters, Reddit Secret Santa, April Fools’ Day events, regional meetups, and many more uplifting moments. We’ve watched this platform grow by leaps and bounds, and although we haven’t been completely happy about every change that we’ve witnessed, we’ve always done our best to work with Reddit at finding ways to adapt, compromise, and move forward. 

This process has occasionally been preceded by some exceptionally public debate, however.

On June 12th, 2023, /r/Funny joined thousands of other subreddits in protesting the planned changes to Reddit’s API; changes which – despite being immediately evident to only a minority of Redditors – threatened to worsen the site for everyone. By June 16th, 2023, that demonstration had evolved to represent a wider (and growing) array of concerns, many of which arose in response to [Reddit’s statements to journalists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/16/reddit-ceo-blackout-moderators-steve-huffman/). Today (June 26th, 2023), we are hopeful that users and administrators alike can make a return to the productive dialogue that has served us in the past. 

We acknowledge that Reddit has placed itself in a situation that makes adjusting its current API roadmap impossible. 

However, we have the following requests:

- Commit to exploring ways by which third-party applications can make an affordable return.
- Commit to providing moderation tools and [accessibility options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/) (on Old Reddit, New Reddit, and mobile platforms) which match or exceed the functionality and utility of third-party applications.
- Commit to prioritizing a significant reduction in spam, misinformation, bigotry, and illegal content on Reddit.
- Guarantee that any future developments which may impact moderators, contributors, or stakeholders will be announced no less than one fiscal quarter before they are scheduled to go into effect.
- Work together with longstanding moderators to establish a reasonable roadmap and deadline for accomplishing all of the above.
- Affirm that efforts meant to keep Reddit accountable to its commitments and deadlines will hereafter not be met with insults, threats, removals, or hostility.
- Publicly affirm all of the above by way of updating Reddit’s User Agreement and Reddit’s Moderator Code of Conduct to include reasonable expectations and requirements for administrators’ behavior. 
- Implement and fill a senior-level role (with decision-making and policy-shaping power) of ""Moderator Advocate"" at Reddit, with a required qualification for the position being robust experience as a volunteer Reddit moderator.

Reddit is unique amongst social-media sites in that its lifeblood – its multitude of moderators and contributors – consists entirely of volunteers. We populate and curate the platform’s many communities, thereby providing a welcoming and engaging environment for all of its visitors. We receive little in the way of thanks for these efforts, but we frequently endure abuse, threats, attacks, and exposure to truly reprehensible media. Historically, we have trusted that Reddit’s administrators have the best interests of the platform and its users (be they moderators, contributors, participants, or lurkers) at heart; that while Reddit may be a for-profit company, it nonetheless recognizes and appreciates the value that Redditors provide. 

That trust has been all but entirely eroded… but we hope that together, we can begin to rebuild it.

In simplest terms, Reddit, we implore you: **Remember the human**. 

We look forward to your response by Thursday, June 29th, 2023.

For fifteen years, /r/Funny has been one of Reddit’s most-popular communities.

Forging A Return to Productive Conversation: An Open Letter to Reddit,Funny_Sentinel,1191,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/14jmh7e/forging_a_return_to_productive_conversation_an/,1,"To All Whom It May Concern:

For fifteen years, /r/Funny has been one of Reddit’s most-popular communities. That time hasn’t been without its difficulties, but for the most part, we’ve all gotten along (with each other and with administrators). Members of our team fondly remember Moderator Roadshows, visits to Reddit’s headquarters, Reddit Secret Santa, April Fools’ Day events, regional meetups, and many more uplifting moments. We’ve watched this platform grow by leaps and bounds, and although we haven’t been completely happy about every change that we’ve witnessed, we’ve always done our best to work with Reddit at finding ways to adapt, compromise, and move forward. 

This process has occasionally been preceded by some exceptionally public debate, however.

On June 12th, 2023, /r/Funny joined thousands of other subreddits in protesting the planned changes to Reddit’s API; changes which – despite being immediately evident to only a minority of Redditors – threatened to worsen the site for everyone. By June 16th, 2023, that demonstration had evolved to represent a wider (and growing) array of concerns, many of which arose in response to [Reddit’s statements to journalists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/16/reddit-ceo-blackout-moderators-steve-huffman/). Today (June 26th, 2023), we are hopeful that users and administrators alike can make a return to the productive dialogue that has served us in the past. 

We acknowledge that Reddit has placed itself in a situation that makes adjusting its current API roadmap impossible. 

However, we have the following requests:

- Commit to exploring ways by which third-party applications can make an affordable return.
- Commit to providing moderation tools and [accessibility options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/) (on Old Reddit, New Reddit, and mobile platforms) which match or exceed the functionality and utility of third-party applications.
- Commit to prioritizing a significant reduction in spam, misinformation, bigotry, and illegal content on Reddit.
- Guarantee that any future developments which may impact moderators, contributors, or stakeholders will be announced no less than one fiscal quarter before they are scheduled to go into effect.
- Work together with longstanding moderators to establish a reasonable roadmap and deadline for accomplishing all of the above.
- Affirm that efforts meant to keep Reddit accountable to its commitments and deadlines will hereafter not be met with insults, threats, removals, or hostility.
- Publicly affirm all of the above by way of updating Reddit’s User Agreement and Reddit’s Moderator Code of Conduct to include reasonable expectations and requirements for administrators’ behavior. 
- Implement and fill a senior-level role (with decision-making and policy-shaping power) of ""Moderator Advocate"" at Reddit, with a required qualification for the position being robust experience as a volunteer Reddit moderator.

Reddit is unique amongst social-media sites in that its lifeblood – its multitude of moderators and contributors – consists entirely of volunteers. We populate and curate the platform’s many communities, thereby providing a welcoming and engaging environment for all of its visitors. We receive little in the way of thanks for these efforts, but we frequently endure abuse, threats, attacks, and exposure to truly reprehensible media. Historically, we have trusted that Reddit’s administrators have the best interests of the platform and its users (be they moderators, contributors, participants, or lurkers) at heart; that while Reddit may be a for-profit company, it nonetheless recognizes and appreciates the value that Redditors provide. 

That trust has been all but entirely eroded… but we hope that together, we can begin to rebuild it.

In simplest terms, Reddit, we implore you: **Remember the human**. 

We look forward to your response by Thursday, June 29th, 2023.

Godzilla 2014 deserved better sequels.,maruhadapurpurine,264,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1d5yorj/godzilla_2014_deserved_better_sequels/,121,"I finally got around to watching those monsterverse movies this week and boy... how did they manage to peak right at the start?

The 2014 movie is so vastly above the sequels in tone and quality that it's hard to believe they belong in the same continuity. Godzilla 2014 is as grounded as a story about a giant lizard monster fighting other giant monsters can be. The human element is much simpler and easier to empathize with. The effects feel years ahead of what came after too. The destruction caused by the monsters fighting feel appropriately bleak while also being super awesome to watch.

I don't think any moment in the sequels ever got me nearly as hyped as when Godzilla shoots his atomic breath down the MUTO's throat. Hell even his first full appearance at Hawaii got me more hyped than anything in the sequels to be honest.

Yeah, I will be the first to agree that for a Godzilla movie there isn't nearly enough Godzilla in it, but maybe they were on to something by keeping his presence so brief until later. The sequels have monsters galore and they're no better for it.

The whole time watching King of the Monsters I was only ever mildly amused by all of it. Gidorah just looked goofy as fuck most of the time because it clashes so much with the semi realism that Godzilla was designed with. The human plot is absolutely awful and should have been cut down by a lot.

Godzilla vs Kong is alright... Sure the fight scenes are cool, but once again the human characters detract way more than add anything to it, especially the podcast guy and the kids. Why are they even here? The stranger things girl's story was over already, why is she back?

And the sci-fi shit was already too much last movie, in this one they just jump the shark completely. It's like they couldn't figure out how to keep the story going so the movies just got progressively dumber with each entry, like a kid mashing toys together. Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy a movie like that, but when you compare it with the 2014 movie it is just so disappointing to see such a major departure in direction. It's like they lost the plot.

Kong Skull Island was fun though. Nice twist to have Samual L Jackson as the villain. I would rank this one just below Godzilla 2014. Even if the tone between them is still completely different at least Skull Island managed to keep itself together by succeeding in the same areas that Godzilla did. Straightforward, centered plot, the human characters contribute to the story instead of detracting from it, great action scenes.

The only one left is Godzilla x Kong and I'm already not expecting anything aside some dumb but fun fight scenes, and just hoping the human characters are cut down to a minimum.

On a side note I also watched Shin Godzilla and will watch Godzilla Minus One as well. The take is so different you can't even really compare them. Shin Godzilla is much more of a political commentary on the japanese government than anything else. I guess that keeps the line much closer to the OG Godzilla movie.

Edit: I finished watching Minus One and GxK The New Empire so here are my brief thoughts.

Minus One: Obviously not related to the monsterverse but it pretty much nails the human element in a Godzilla movie. Even when you know where te story is going it still hits the emotional notes. Because of that I would say it is overall better than the 2014 version (though I would still say that 2014 has better hype moments. You just can't top that atomic breath straight down the MUTO's mouth.)

GxK: This movie is completely ridiculous in every way possible and it just cemented my thoughts on this. Regardless of what I think about the quality of the sequels, these movies absolutely shouldn't be in the same universe. The tone is too different, the world is simply not the same. There is no way you can watch GxK and then look at 2014 Godzilla and say they fit together. It just doesn't work. Again, I'm not against movies like this. They have an audience, and I can honestly say I had some fun watching it, but it should've been its own thing and not related to the 2014 movie, which in turn deserved a sequel much more in line with its tone and vision of the Godzilla universe.",1717281094.0,Text

"Debate, dissent, and protest on Reddit",spez,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/pbmy5y/debate_dissent_and_protest_on_reddit/,1,"Hey everyone–

The pandemic has been extremely hard on many of us. We believe the best way forward for everyone is to [get vaccinated](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) and continue to follow [CDC guidance on masking](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html). Throughout the pandemic, we have also provided COVID-related resources to support our volunteer moderators, users, and communities, including a dedicated AMA series connecting users with [authoritative experts on coronavirus](https://redditblog.com/2020/03/02/expert-conversation-on-coronavirus/) and [vaccines](https://redditblog.com/2021/01/28/introducing-a-new-reddit-ama-series-everything-you-want-to-know-about-covid-19-vaccines/), as well as deploying homepage and search page banners directing users to the CDC and r/Coronavirus.

We appreciate that not everyone agrees with the current approach to getting us all through the pandemic, and some are still wary of vaccinations. Dissent is a part of Reddit and the foundation of democracy. Reddit is a place for open and authentic discussion and debate. This includes conversations that question or disagree with popular consensus. This includes conversations that criticize those that disagree with the majority opinion. This includes protests that criticize or object to our decisions on which communities to ban from the platform.

While we appreciate the sentiment of those demanding that we ban more communities that challenge consensus views on the pandemic, we continue to believe in the good of our communities and hope that we collectively approach the challenges of the pandemic with empathy, compassion, and a willingness to understand what others are going through, even when their viewpoint on the pandemic is different from yours. 

When it comes to COVID-19 specifically, what we know and what are the current best practices from authoritative sources, like the CDC, evolve continuously with new learnings. Given the rapid state of change, we believe it is best to enable communities to engage in debate and dissent, and for us to link to the CDC wherever appropriate. While we believe the CDC is the best and most up to date source of information regarding COVID-19, disagreeing with them is not against our policies.

However, manipulating or cheating Reddit to amplify any particular viewpoint is against our policies, and we will continue to action communities that do so or that violate any of our other rules, including those dedicated to fraud (e.g. fake vaccine cards) or encouraging harm (e.g. consuming bleach); and we will continue to use our quarantine tool to link to authoritative sources and warn people they may encounter unsound advice. We humbly ask and encourage everyone to report content that may violate our policies.

\*We are using our [political ads system](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/ipitt0/today_were_testing_a_new_way_to_discuss_political/) to facilitate discussion of this post within the context of your own communities.",1629933302.0,Text

We will continue to run exchanges through the end of the year -- including the last ever Arbitrary Day (signups are [now open](https://www.redditgifts.com/exchanges/a-day-21/)) -- and will end with Secret Santa 2021. 

**We didn’t make this decision lightly.** 

We made the difficult decision to shut down Reddit Gifts and put more focus on enhancing the [user experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/mqcpcg/you_want_a_better_reddit_search_ok_were_on_it/) on Reddit - this includes [investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/ldgmfc/diamond_hands_on_the_data/) in the [foundation](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/nudfv1/the_rollout_of_reputation_service/) [of our](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/lb2p7a/a_new_video_player_updated_email_designs_mobile/) [platform](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/neknjg/evolving_beyond_100_billion_recommendations_a_day/) and [moderator tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/nk7p7j/new_updates_to_help_moderators_your_monthly/), making it more [accessible](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/mzse3p/control_over_your_followers_spring_avatar_gear_a/) for people around the world and evolving how people [engage](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/nmhmj0/q1_safety_security_report_may_27_2021/) with one another. 

The power of Reddit Gifts was never in the software, and has always belonged to the r/secretsanta community of gifters around the world, which has connected people and been an extension of our mission to bring community and belonging to everyone in the world. We’re hopeful that spirit will continue in the future. 

**What this means for future exchanges in 2021**

In preparation for retiring Reddit Gifts after the final exchange at the end of 2021, we will be taking the following actions: 

* In order to limit incomplete exchanges, we have disabled the creation of any new Reddit Gifts accounts. If you have an existing Reddit Gifts account, we would love it if you would participate with us in these final exchanges. 
* Any incomplete exchanges will result in a ban from the remaining Reddit Gifts exchanges.
* This morning, we turned off the ability to buy [Elves](https://www.redditgifts.com/Elves/). If you purchased an Elves membership and have remaining months after the 2021 Secret Santa Exchange, we will email you about your refund options then. If you have specific concerns about your Elves membership, please reach out to Reddit Gifts [support](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000825092). 

These changes have been put in place to ensure that these last exchanges are enjoyable for the legacy Reddit Gifts users. We want to celebrate the end of Reddit Gifts with the community that we’ve built so far. 

Countless acts of love, heroism, compassion, support, growth and hilarity happened through Reddit Gifts, and those memories will live on in the hearts of our community. We’re working on ways to capture these moments and look forward to seeing how the spirit and connection of exchanging gifts with strangers will live on.

As of today, the employee in question is no longer employed by Reddit. We built a relationship with her first as a mod and then through her contractor work on RPAN. We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her. 

We’ve put significant effort into improving how we handle doxxing and harassment, and this employee was the subject of both. In this case, we over-indexed on protection, which had serious consequences in terms of enforcement actions. 

* On March 9th, we added extra protections for this employee, including actioning content that mentioned the employee’s name or shared personal information on third-party sites, which we reserve for serious cases of harassment and doxxing.
* On March 22nd, a news article about this employee was posted by a mod of r/ukpolitics. The article was removed and the submitter banned by the aforementioned rules. When contacted by the moderators of r/ukpolitics, we reviewed the actions, and reversed the ban on the moderator, and we informed the r/ukpolitics moderation team that we had restored the mod.
* We updated our rules to flag potential harassment for human review.

Debate and criticism have always been and always will be central to conversation on Reddit—including discussion about public figures and Reddit itself—as long as they are not used as vehicles for harassment. Mentioning a public figure’s name should not get you banned.

We care deeply for Reddit and appreciate that you do too. We understand the anger and confusion about these issues and their bigger implications. The employee is no longer with Reddit, and we’ll be evolving a number of relevant internal policies.

Today we’re testing a new way to discuss political ads (and announcements),spez,17312,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/ipitt0/today_were_testing_a_new_way_to_discuss_political/,2,"In case you missed [the](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/ikxsst/this_reddit_billboard_advertisement_for_their/) [billboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ilhck2/saw_one_in_the_wild_make_sure_to_vote_illinois/), [blog posts](https://redditblog.com/2020/09/01/its-national-poll-worker-recruitment-day-become-a-poll-worker-this-election-and-help-power-the-polls-in-your-community/), and [AMAs](https://redditblog.com/2020/08/25/voting-in-america/), we’re doing our best to encourage people on and off Reddit to vote this year. Along with our [Up the Vote campaign](https://redditblog.com/2020/07/29/up-the-vote-reddits-irl-2020-voting-campaign/) and [ongoing security and safety work](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/) to guard against shenanigans, we’ve also been evolving how we handle another important aspect of the election process: **political ads**.

## First, some background

Political ads have been a relatively quiet part of Reddit for many years. Last year, in thinking through what the right balance was between unfettered political ads and prohibiting them altogether for 2020 (both approaches that other platforms have taken), we decided on [a policy we felt was the best approach for Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/g0s6tn/changes_to_reddits_political_ads_policy/): no misinformation, human review of the ads and where they link, a subreddit listing all political ads ([r/RedditPoliticalAds](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditPoliticalAds/)), and a requirement to keep comments on for 24 hours.

Since debuting this policy earlier this year, the last condition (requiring comments to remain on) has enabled redditors to discuss political ads—providing more context in the comments and even offering counterarguments—but so far it’s only been lightly used. As we get closer to November, however, the prominence of and discussion around political ads will increase, and, with it, the need for a clear moderation system for these comments.

## The problem we’re addressing

As I mentioned [a couple months back](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/fwdxoty/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3&depth=2), unmoderated spaces on Reddit are an area we want to improve, from Modmail to PM’s, and political ads pose a unique challenge.

If the OP of a political ad (i.e., a campaign) moderates the comments, it’s problematic: they might remove dissenting perspectives. And if we (the admins) moderate the comments of a political ad, it’s even more problematic, putting us in the position of either moderating too much or too little, with inevitable accusations of bias either way.

The problem, we realized, is similar to what we see in r/announcements: lots of people commenting on a highly visible post outside the context of a community. It’s fair to say that r/announcements isn’t really a community; it lacks the culture, cohesion, and moderation that benefit most other subreddits, and as a result, the quality of conversation has deteriorated as the audience has grown.

Ultimately, conversations really only happen in the context of a community, and neither r/announcements nor political ads with comments on provide this. We believe we can foster better discussion on both with a different approach.

## What we’re testing today

Instead of having the usual free-for-all of comments on the r/announcements post itself, we are trying out a new experience today that encourages discussion of this post within other communities—an approach we hope works for political ads as well.

Below is a stickied comment with a link to submit this post to other communities on Reddit and a list of those discussion posts. The stickied comment will update automatically with new posts.

A few other details to note for this test:

* **The discussion posts are like any other post**, which means they can be voted on by users and removed by mods.
* **Communities that don’t want to participate don’t have to.** (If you’re a mod of a community where a user attempts to crosspost this, you will get a Modmail alerting you to this with [opt-out instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/).)
* **Individual community rules apply to these posts just as any other**, so read the rules before attempting to bring the discussion into a completely unrelated community.
* **Our stickied comment will link to discussions only from communities subject to our ads allow list.** Communities that have already opted not to appear in r/all won’t appear in the comment either, even if there is a discussion of this post there.
* **After today’s test, we will likely test this system with political ads.**

This test will be a success if there are a variety of posts and conversations about this post, even—and perhaps particularly—if they are critical.

## How we’re answering questions

r/announcements posts have an important difference from political ads: I treat them as AMAs and do my best to answer questions and respond to criticism (both of which I appreciate). With this approach, I expect doing so will be more difficult (at least this first time). However, the point of this test is not to make you hunt for our answers or for us to reply to fewer questions, and we don’t intend to use this approach for all our admin posts (e.g., in r/ModNews, r/changelog, r/ModSupport, and others, which are smaller subreddits that still work well).

For today, we’re going to make the first link of this post to r/ModNews and start by answering mods’ questions there. In a future announcement, we may ask a specific community if they would host us for the discussion that day (depending on what the announcement is) and set that as an official destination for discussion, like a regular AMA.

Additionally, I’ll do my best to find other places to respond, and we’ll maintain another comment below this post to list replies we’ve given outside of r/announcements so you can easily find our responses (which was a feature request from [our post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/g3r4xpm/) last week).

Ultimately, the goal of this test is to enable Reddit to do what Reddit does best: facilitate conversations (within the context of a community), provide commentary on political ads the way redditors already do on news and politics daily (sharing more information and calling bullshit in the comments when necessary), and extend the discussion well beyond the scope of the original post.

Thank you for participating. We hope this approach sets the stage for successful commentary not just today but down the road on political ads as well.

**Edit (9/28/20):** Update: After initial testing and a few small tweaks to the sorting and score display of the links in stickied comments like the one below, we’ll be using this discussion system on political ads moving forward. 

As I mentioned, our goal with this approach was to encourage these types of discussions to happen within the context of a community. While this feature is completely optional for communities (opt-out instructions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/)), we were pleased overall with the level of engagement that we saw from communities and users on this test post.

We’re still exploring how we’ll use this feature for r/announcements posts and how we can work with specific communities to have discussions about them.

Update to Our Content Policy,spez,21320,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/,38595,"[A few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/), we committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate. After talking extensively with mods, outside organizations, and our own teams, we’re updating our content policy today and enforcing it (with your help).

## First, a quick recap

Since our last post, here’s what we’ve been doing:

* **We brought on a** [**new Board member**](https://redditblog.com/2020/06/10/reddit-welcomes-michael-seibel-to-board-of-directors/).
* **We held policy calls with mods**—both from established Mod Councils and from communities disproportionately targeted with hate—and discussed areas where we can do better to action bad actors, clarify our policies, make mods' lives easier, and concretely reduce hate.
   * You can find [detailed notes from our All-Council mod call here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hi3nkr/the_mod_conversations_that_went_into_todays), including specific product work we discussed.
* **We developed our enforcement plan**, including both our immediate actions (e.g., today’s bans) and long-term investments (tackling the most critical work discussed in our mod calls, sustainably enforcing the new policies, and advancing Reddit’s community governance).

From our conversations with mods and outside experts, it’s clear that while we’ve gotten better in some areas—like actioning violations at the community level, [scaling enforcement efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/hbiuas/reddit_security_report_june_18_2020/), measurably reducing hateful experiences like harassment [year over year](https://www.adl.org/online-hate-2020#results)—we still have a long way to go to address the gaps in our policies and enforcement to date.

These include addressing questions our policies have left unanswered (like whether hate speech is allowed or even protected on Reddit), aspects of our product and mod tools that are still too easy for individual bad actors to abuse (inboxes, chats, modmail), and areas where we can do better to partner with our mods and communities who want to combat the same hateful conduct we do.

Ultimately, it’s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. In the near term, this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.

## New Policy

This is the [new content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). Here’s what’s different:

* It starts with a statement of our vision for Reddit and our communities, including the basic expectations we have for all communities and users.
* **Rule 1** explicitly states that communities and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.
   * There is an expanded definition of what constitutes a violation of this rule, along with specific examples, in our [Help Center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).
* **Rule 2** ties together our previous rules on prohibited behavior with an ask to abide by community rules and post with authentic, personal interest.
   * Debate and creativity are welcome, but spam and malicious attempts to interfere with other communities are not.
* The other rules are the same in spirit but have been rewritten for clarity and inclusiveness.

Alongside the change to the content policy, we are initially banning about 2000 subreddits, the vast majority of which are inactive. Of these communities, about [200](https://www.redditstatic.com/banned-subreddits-june-2020.txt) have more than 10 daily users. Both r/The_Donald and r/ChapoTrapHouse were included.

All communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so, despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1), antagonized us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8), and its mods have refused to meet our most basic expectations. Until now, we’ve worked in good faith to help them preserve the community as a space for its users—through warnings, mod changes, quarantining, and more.

Though smaller, r/ChapoTrapHouse was banned for similar reasons: They consistently host rule-breaking content and their mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.

To be clear, views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit—but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith, without exception.

## Our commitment

Our policies will never be perfect, with new edge cases that inevitably lead us to evolve them in the future. And as users, you will always have more context, community vernacular, and cultural values to inform the standards set within your communities than we as site admins or any AI ever could.

But just as our content moderation cannot scale effectively without your support, you need more support from us as well, and we admit we have fallen short towards this end. We are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors, abusive behaviors, and toxic communities that undermine our mission and get in the way of the creativity, discussions, and communities that bring us all to Reddit in the first place. We hope that our progress towards this commitment, with today’s update and those to come, makes Reddit a place you enjoy and are proud to be a part of for many years to come.

Edit: After digesting feedback, we made a clarifying change to our help center article for [Promoting Hate Based on Identity or Vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).",1593450006.0,Text
"Upcoming changes to our content policy, our board, and where we’re going from here",spez,40925,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/,40768,"**TL;DR: We’re working with mods to change our content policy to explicitly address hate.** u/kn0thing **has resigned from our board to fill his seat with a Black candidate, a request we will honor. I want to take responsibility for the history of our policies over the years that got us here, and we still have work to do.**

After watching people across the country mourn and demand an end to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people, I wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it, a duty to speak out.

Earlier this week, I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, “How can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?”

These questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy. 

Over the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities—across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could’ve imagined when we first created subreddits—and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.

However, as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:

* Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. 
* Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. 
* Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.

We are already working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it’s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.

We will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn’t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.

And just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he’s done for us over the years.

At the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.

In the early days of Reddit, 2005–2006, our idealistic “policy” was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our “policy.” 

I left Reddit from 2010–2015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit’s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). 

When I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what’s acceptable on Reddit and what’s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were “making Reddit worse” but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. 

While we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity—and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules, but also isn’t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.

This inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, “Breaking Reddit” was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.

The majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. 

Despite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.

I will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.

"Debate, dissent, and protest on Reddit",spez,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/pbmy5y/debate_dissent_and_protest_on_reddit/,1,"Hey everyone–

The pandemic has been extremely hard on many of us. We believe the best way forward for everyone is to [get vaccinated](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) and continue to follow [CDC guidance on masking](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html). Throughout the pandemic, we have also provided COVID-related resources to support our volunteer moderators, users, and communities, including a dedicated AMA series connecting users with [authoritative experts on coronavirus](https://redditblog.com/2020/03/02/expert-conversation-on-coronavirus/) and [vaccines](https://redditblog.com/2021/01/28/introducing-a-new-reddit-ama-series-everything-you-want-to-know-about-covid-19-vaccines/), as well as deploying homepage and search page banners directing users to the CDC and r/Coronavirus.

We appreciate that not everyone agrees with the current approach to getting us all through the pandemic, and some are still wary of vaccinations. Dissent is a part of Reddit and the foundation of democracy. Reddit is a place for open and authentic discussion and debate. This includes conversations that question or disagree with popular consensus. This includes conversations that criticize those that disagree with the majority opinion. This includes protests that criticize or object to our decisions on which communities to ban from the platform.

While we appreciate the sentiment of those demanding that we ban more communities that challenge consensus views on the pandemic, we continue to believe in the good of our communities and hope that we collectively approach the challenges of the pandemic with empathy, compassion, and a willingness to understand what others are going through, even when their viewpoint on the pandemic is different from yours. 

When it comes to COVID-19 specifically, what we know and what are the current best practices from authoritative sources, like the CDC, evolve continuously with new learnings. Given the rapid state of change, we believe it is best to enable communities to engage in debate and dissent, and for us to link to the CDC wherever appropriate. While we believe the CDC is the best and most up to date source of information regarding COVID-19, disagreeing with them is not against our policies.

However, manipulating or cheating Reddit to amplify any particular viewpoint is against our policies, and we will continue to action communities that do so or that violate any of our other rules, including those dedicated to fraud (e.g. fake vaccine cards) or encouraging harm (e.g. consuming bleach); and we will continue to use our quarantine tool to link to authoritative sources and warn people they may encounter unsound advice. We humbly ask and encourage everyone to report content that may violate our policies.

We will continue to run exchanges through the end of the year -- including the last ever Arbitrary Day (signups are [now open](https://www.redditgifts.com/exchanges/a-day-21/)) -- and will end with Secret Santa 2021. 

**We didn’t make this decision lightly.** 

We made the difficult decision to shut down Reddit Gifts and put more focus on enhancing the [user experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/mqcpcg/you_want_a_better_reddit_search_ok_were_on_it/) on Reddit - this includes [investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/ldgmfc/diamond_hands_on_the_data/) in the [foundation](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/nudfv1/the_rollout_of_reputation_service/) [of our](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/lb2p7a/a_new_video_player_updated_email_designs_mobile/) [platform](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/neknjg/evolving_beyond_100_billion_recommendations_a_day/) and [moderator tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/nk7p7j/new_updates_to_help_moderators_your_monthly/), making it more [accessible](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/mzse3p/control_over_your_followers_spring_avatar_gear_a/) for people around the world and evolving how people [engage](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/nmhmj0/q1_safety_security_report_may_27_2021/) with one another. 

The power of Reddit Gifts was never in the software, and has always belonged to the r/secretsanta community of gifters around the world, which has connected people and been an extension of our mission to bring community and belonging to everyone in the world. We’re hopeful that spirit will continue in the future. 

**What this means for future exchanges in 2021**

In preparation for retiring Reddit Gifts after the final exchange at the end of 2021, we will be taking the following actions: 

* In order to limit incomplete exchanges, we have disabled the creation of any new Reddit Gifts accounts. If you have an existing Reddit Gifts account, we would love it if you would participate with us in these final exchanges. 
* Any incomplete exchanges will result in a ban from the remaining Reddit Gifts exchanges.
* This morning, we turned off the ability to buy [Elves](https://www.redditgifts.com/Elves/). If you purchased an Elves membership and have remaining months after the 2021 Secret Santa Exchange, we will email you about your refund options then. If you have specific concerns about your Elves membership, please reach out to Reddit Gifts [support](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000825092). 

These changes have been put in place to ensure that these last exchanges are enjoyable for the legacy Reddit Gifts users. We want to celebrate the end of Reddit Gifts with the community that we’ve built so far. 

Countless acts of love, heroism, compassion, support, growth and hilarity happened through Reddit Gifts, and those memories will live on in the hearts of our community. We’re working on ways to capture these moments and look forward to seeing how the spirit and connection of exchanging gifts with strangers will live on.

As of today, the employee in question is no longer employed by Reddit. We built a relationship with her first as a mod and then through her contractor work on RPAN. We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her. 

We’ve put significant effort into improving how we handle doxxing and harassment, and this employee was the subject of both. In this case, we over-indexed on protection, which had serious consequences in terms of enforcement actions. 

* On March 9th, we added extra protections for this employee, including actioning content that mentioned the employee’s name or shared personal information on third-party sites, which we reserve for serious cases of harassment and doxxing.
* On March 22nd, a news article about this employee was posted by a mod of r/ukpolitics. The article was removed and the submitter banned by the aforementioned rules. When contacted by the moderators of r/ukpolitics, we reviewed the actions, and reversed the ban on the moderator, and we informed the r/ukpolitics moderation team that we had restored the mod.
* We updated our rules to flag potential harassment for human review.

Debate and criticism have always been and always will be central to conversation on Reddit—including discussion about public figures and Reddit itself—as long as they are not used as vehicles for harassment. Mentioning a public figure’s name should not get you banned.

We care deeply for Reddit and appreciate that you do too. We understand the anger and confusion about these issues and their bigger implications. The employee is no longer with Reddit, and we’ll be evolving a number of relevant internal policies.

Today we’re testing a new way to discuss political ads (and announcements),spez,17318,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/ipitt0/today_were_testing_a_new_way_to_discuss_political/,2,"In case you missed [the](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/ikxsst/this_reddit_billboard_advertisement_for_their/) [billboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ilhck2/saw_one_in_the_wild_make_sure_to_vote_illinois/), [blog posts](https://redditblog.com/2020/09/01/its-national-poll-worker-recruitment-day-become-a-poll-worker-this-election-and-help-power-the-polls-in-your-community/), and [AMAs](https://redditblog.com/2020/08/25/voting-in-america/), we’re doing our best to encourage people on and off Reddit to vote this year. Along with our [Up the Vote campaign](https://redditblog.com/2020/07/29/up-the-vote-reddits-irl-2020-voting-campaign/) and [ongoing security and safety work](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/) to guard against shenanigans, we’ve also been evolving how we handle another important aspect of the election process: **political ads**.

## First, some background

Political ads have been a relatively quiet part of Reddit for many years. Last year, in thinking through what the right balance was between unfettered political ads and prohibiting them altogether for 2020 (both approaches that other platforms have taken), we decided on [a policy we felt was the best approach for Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/g0s6tn/changes_to_reddits_political_ads_policy/): no misinformation, human review of the ads and where they link, a subreddit listing all political ads ([r/RedditPoliticalAds](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditPoliticalAds/)), and a requirement to keep comments on for 24 hours.

Since debuting this policy earlier this year, the last condition (requiring comments to remain on) has enabled redditors to discuss political ads—providing more context in the comments and even offering counterarguments—but so far it’s only been lightly used. As we get closer to November, however, the prominence of and discussion around political ads will increase, and, with it, the need for a clear moderation system for these comments.

## The problem we’re addressing

As I mentioned [a couple months back](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/fwdxoty/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3&depth=2), unmoderated spaces on Reddit are an area we want to improve, from Modmail to PM’s, and political ads pose a unique challenge.

If the OP of a political ad (i.e., a campaign) moderates the comments, it’s problematic: they might remove dissenting perspectives. And if we (the admins) moderate the comments of a political ad, it’s even more problematic, putting us in the position of either moderating too much or too little, with inevitable accusations of bias either way.

The problem, we realized, is similar to what we see in r/announcements: lots of people commenting on a highly visible post outside the context of a community. It’s fair to say that r/announcements isn’t really a community; it lacks the culture, cohesion, and moderation that benefit most other subreddits, and as a result, the quality of conversation has deteriorated as the audience has grown.

Ultimately, conversations really only happen in the context of a community, and neither r/announcements nor political ads with comments on provide this. We believe we can foster better discussion on both with a different approach.

## What we’re testing today

Instead of having the usual free-for-all of comments on the r/announcements post itself, we are trying out a new experience today that encourages discussion of this post within other communities—an approach we hope works for political ads as well.

Below is a stickied comment with a link to submit this post to other communities on Reddit and a list of those discussion posts. The stickied comment will update automatically with new posts.

A few other details to note for this test:

* **The discussion posts are like any other post**, which means they can be voted on by users and removed by mods.
* **Communities that don’t want to participate don’t have to.** (If you’re a mod of a community where a user attempts to crosspost this, you will get a Modmail alerting you to this with [opt-out instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/).)
* **Individual community rules apply to these posts just as any other**, so read the rules before attempting to bring the discussion into a completely unrelated community.
* **Our stickied comment will link to discussions only from communities subject to our ads allow list.** Communities that have already opted not to appear in r/all won’t appear in the comment either, even if there is a discussion of this post there.
* **After today’s test, we will likely test this system with political ads.**

This test will be a success if there are a variety of posts and conversations about this post, even—and perhaps particularly—if they are critical.

## How we’re answering questions

r/announcements posts have an important difference from political ads: I treat them as AMAs and do my best to answer questions and respond to criticism (both of which I appreciate). With this approach, I expect doing so will be more difficult (at least this first time). However, the point of this test is not to make you hunt for our answers or for us to reply to fewer questions, and we don’t intend to use this approach for all our admin posts (e.g., in r/ModNews, r/changelog, r/ModSupport, and others, which are smaller subreddits that still work well).

For today, we’re going to make the first link of this post to r/ModNews and start by answering mods’ questions there. In a future announcement, we may ask a specific community if they would host us for the discussion that day (depending on what the announcement is) and set that as an official destination for discussion, like a regular AMA.

Additionally, I’ll do my best to find other places to respond, and we’ll maintain another comment below this post to list replies we’ve given outside of r/announcements so you can easily find our responses (which was a feature request from [our post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/g3r4xpm/) last week).

Ultimately, the goal of this test is to enable Reddit to do what Reddit does best: facilitate conversations (within the context of a community), provide commentary on political ads the way redditors already do on news and politics daily (sharing more information and calling bullshit in the comments when necessary), and extend the discussion well beyond the scope of the original post.

Thank you for participating. We hope this approach sets the stage for successful commentary not just today but down the road on political ads as well.

**Edit (9/28/20):** Update: After initial testing and a few small tweaks to the sorting and score display of the links in stickied comments like the one below, we’ll be using this discussion system on political ads moving forward. 

As I mentioned, our goal with this approach was to encourage these types of discussions to happen within the context of a community. While this feature is completely optional for communities (opt-out instructions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/)), we were pleased overall with the level of engagement that we saw from communities and users on this test post.

We’re still exploring how we’ll use this feature for r/announcements posts and how we can work with specific communities to have discussions about them.

Update to Our Content Policy,spez,21320,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/,38595,"[A few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/), we committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate. After talking extensively with mods, outside organizations, and our own teams, we’re updating our content policy today and enforcing it (with your help).

## First, a quick recap

Since our last post, here’s what we’ve been doing:

* **We brought on a** [**new Board member**](https://redditblog.com/2020/06/10/reddit-welcomes-michael-seibel-to-board-of-directors/).
* **We held policy calls with mods**—both from established Mod Councils and from communities disproportionately targeted with hate—and discussed areas where we can do better to action bad actors, clarify our policies, make mods' lives easier, and concretely reduce hate.
   * You can find [detailed notes from our All-Council mod call here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hi3nkr/the_mod_conversations_that_went_into_todays), including specific product work we discussed.
* **We developed our enforcement plan**, including both our immediate actions (e.g., today’s bans) and long-term investments (tackling the most critical work discussed in our mod calls, sustainably enforcing the new policies, and advancing Reddit’s community governance).

From our conversations with mods and outside experts, it’s clear that while we’ve gotten better in some areas—like actioning violations at the community level, [scaling enforcement efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/hbiuas/reddit_security_report_june_18_2020/), measurably reducing hateful experiences like harassment [year over year](https://www.adl.org/online-hate-2020#results)—we still have a long way to go to address the gaps in our policies and enforcement to date.

These include addressing questions our policies have left unanswered (like whether hate speech is allowed or even protected on Reddit), aspects of our product and mod tools that are still too easy for individual bad actors to abuse (inboxes, chats, modmail), and areas where we can do better to partner with our mods and communities who want to combat the same hateful conduct we do.

Ultimately, it’s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. In the near term, this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.

## New Policy

This is the [new content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). Here’s what’s different:

* It starts with a statement of our vision for Reddit and our communities, including the basic expectations we have for all communities and users.
* **Rule 1** explicitly states that communities and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.
   * There is an expanded definition of what constitutes a violation of this rule, along with specific examples, in our [Help Center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).
* **Rule 2** ties together our previous rules on prohibited behavior with an ask to abide by community rules and post with authentic, personal interest.
   * Debate and creativity are welcome, but spam and malicious attempts to interfere with other communities are not.
* The other rules are the same in spirit but have been rewritten for clarity and inclusiveness.

Alongside the change to the content policy, we are initially banning about 2000 subreddits, the vast majority of which are inactive. Of these communities, about [200](https://www.redditstatic.com/banned-subreddits-june-2020.txt) have more than 10 daily users. Both r/The_Donald and r/ChapoTrapHouse were included.

All communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so, despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1), antagonized us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8), and its mods have refused to meet our most basic expectations. Until now, we’ve worked in good faith to help them preserve the community as a space for its users—through warnings, mod changes, quarantining, and more.

Though smaller, r/ChapoTrapHouse was banned for similar reasons: They consistently host rule-breaking content and their mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.

To be clear, views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit—but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith, without exception.

## Our commitment

Our policies will never be perfect, with new edge cases that inevitably lead us to evolve them in the future. And as users, you will always have more context, community vernacular, and cultural values to inform the standards set within your communities than we as site admins or any AI ever could.

But just as our content moderation cannot scale effectively without your support, you need more support from us as well, and we admit we have fallen short towards this end. We are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors, abusive behaviors, and toxic communities that undermine our mission and get in the way of the creativity, discussions, and communities that bring us all to Reddit in the first place. We hope that our progress towards this commitment, with today’s update and those to come, makes Reddit a place you enjoy and are proud to be a part of for many years to come.

Edit: After digesting feedback, we made a clarifying change to our help center article for [Promoting Hate Based on Identity or Vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).",1593450006.0,Text
"Upcoming changes to our content policy, our board, and where we’re going from here",spez,40926,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/,40768,"**TL;DR: We’re working with mods to change our content policy to explicitly address hate.** u/kn0thing **has resigned from our board to fill his seat with a Black candidate, a request we will honor. I want to take responsibility for the history of our policies over the years that got us here, and we still have work to do.**

After watching people across the country mourn and demand an end to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people, I wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it, a duty to speak out.

Earlier this week, I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, “How can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?”

These questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy. 

Over the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities—across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could’ve imagined when we first created subreddits—and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.

However, as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:

* Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. 
* Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. 
* Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.

We are already working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it’s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.

We will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn’t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.

And just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he’s done for us over the years.

At the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.

In the early days of Reddit, 2005–2006, our idealistic “policy” was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our “policy.” 

I left Reddit from 2010–2015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit’s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). 

When I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what’s acceptable on Reddit and what’s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were “making Reddit worse” but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. 

While we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity—and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules, but also isn’t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.

This inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, “Breaking Reddit” was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.

The majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. 

Despite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.

I will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.

"Debate, dissent, and protest on Reddit",spez,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/pbmy5y/debate_dissent_and_protest_on_reddit/,1,"Hey everyone–

The pandemic has been extremely hard on many of us. We believe the best way forward for everyone is to [get vaccinated](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) and continue to follow [CDC guidance on masking](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html). Throughout the pandemic, we have also provided COVID-related resources to support our volunteer moderators, users, and communities, including a dedicated AMA series connecting users with [authoritative experts on coronavirus](https://redditblog.com/2020/03/02/expert-conversation-on-coronavirus/) and [vaccines](https://redditblog.com/2021/01/28/introducing-a-new-reddit-ama-series-everything-you-want-to-know-about-covid-19-vaccines/), as well as deploying homepage and search page banners directing users to the CDC and r/Coronavirus.

We appreciate that not everyone agrees with the current approach to getting us all through the pandemic, and some are still wary of vaccinations. Dissent is a part of Reddit and the foundation of democracy. Reddit is a place for open and authentic discussion and debate. This includes conversations that question or disagree with popular consensus. This includes conversations that criticize those that disagree with the majority opinion. This includes protests that criticize or object to our decisions on which communities to ban from the platform.

While we appreciate the sentiment of those demanding that we ban more communities that challenge consensus views on the pandemic, we continue to believe in the good of our communities and hope that we collectively approach the challenges of the pandemic with empathy, compassion, and a willingness to understand what others are going through, even when their viewpoint on the pandemic is different from yours. 

When it comes to COVID-19 specifically, what we know and what are the current best practices from authoritative sources, like the CDC, evolve continuously with new learnings. Given the rapid state of change, we believe it is best to enable communities to engage in debate and dissent, and for us to link to the CDC wherever appropriate. While we believe the CDC is the best and most up to date source of information regarding COVID-19, disagreeing with them is not against our policies.

However, manipulating or cheating Reddit to amplify any particular viewpoint is against our policies, and we will continue to action communities that do so or that violate any of our other rules, including those dedicated to fraud (e.g. fake vaccine cards) or encouraging harm (e.g. consuming bleach); and we will continue to use our quarantine tool to link to authoritative sources and warn people they may encounter unsound advice. We humbly ask and encourage everyone to report content that may violate our policies.

We will continue to run exchanges through the end of the year -- including the last ever Arbitrary Day (signups are [now open](https://www.redditgifts.com/exchanges/a-day-21/)) -- and will end with Secret Santa 2021. 

**We didn’t make this decision lightly.** 

We made the difficult decision to shut down Reddit Gifts and put more focus on enhancing the [user experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/mqcpcg/you_want_a_better_reddit_search_ok_were_on_it/) on Reddit - this includes [investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/ldgmfc/diamond_hands_on_the_data/) in the [foundation](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/nudfv1/the_rollout_of_reputation_service/) [of our](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/lb2p7a/a_new_video_player_updated_email_designs_mobile/) [platform](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/neknjg/evolving_beyond_100_billion_recommendations_a_day/) and [moderator tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/nk7p7j/new_updates_to_help_moderators_your_monthly/), making it more [accessible](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/mzse3p/control_over_your_followers_spring_avatar_gear_a/) for people around the world and evolving how people [engage](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/nmhmj0/q1_safety_security_report_may_27_2021/) with one another. 

The power of Reddit Gifts was never in the software, and has always belonged to the r/secretsanta community of gifters around the world, which has connected people and been an extension of our mission to bring community and belonging to everyone in the world. We’re hopeful that spirit will continue in the future. 

**What this means for future exchanges in 2021**

In preparation for retiring Reddit Gifts after the final exchange at the end of 2021, we will be taking the following actions: 

* In order to limit incomplete exchanges, we have disabled the creation of any new Reddit Gifts accounts. If you have an existing Reddit Gifts account, we would love it if you would participate with us in these final exchanges. 
* Any incomplete exchanges will result in a ban from the remaining Reddit Gifts exchanges.
* This morning, we turned off the ability to buy [Elves](https://www.redditgifts.com/Elves/). If you purchased an Elves membership and have remaining months after the 2021 Secret Santa Exchange, we will email you about your refund options then. If you have specific concerns about your Elves membership, please reach out to Reddit Gifts [support](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000825092). 

These changes have been put in place to ensure that these last exchanges are enjoyable for the legacy Reddit Gifts users. We want to celebrate the end of Reddit Gifts with the community that we’ve built so far. 

Countless acts of love, heroism, compassion, support, growth and hilarity happened through Reddit Gifts, and those memories will live on in the hearts of our community. We’re working on ways to capture these moments and look forward to seeing how the spirit and connection of exchanging gifts with strangers will live on.

As of today, the employee in question is no longer employed by Reddit. We built a relationship with her first as a mod and then through her contractor work on RPAN. We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her. 

We’ve put significant effort into improving how we handle doxxing and harassment, and this employee was the subject of both. In this case, we over-indexed on protection, which had serious consequences in terms of enforcement actions. 

* On March 9th, we added extra protections for this employee, including actioning content that mentioned the employee’s name or shared personal information on third-party sites, which we reserve for serious cases of harassment and doxxing.
* On March 22nd, a news article about this employee was posted by a mod of r/ukpolitics. The article was removed and the submitter banned by the aforementioned rules. When contacted by the moderators of r/ukpolitics, we reviewed the actions, and reversed the ban on the moderator, and we informed the r/ukpolitics moderation team that we had restored the mod.
* We updated our rules to flag potential harassment for human review.

Debate and criticism have always been and always will be central to conversation on Reddit—including discussion about public figures and Reddit itself—as long as they are not used as vehicles for harassment. Mentioning a public figure’s name should not get you banned.

We care deeply for Reddit and appreciate that you do too. We understand the anger and confusion about these issues and their bigger implications. The employee is no longer with Reddit, and we’ll be evolving a number of relevant internal policies.

Today we’re testing a new way to discuss political ads (and announcements),spez,17312,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/ipitt0/today_were_testing_a_new_way_to_discuss_political/,2,"In case you missed [the](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/ikxsst/this_reddit_billboard_advertisement_for_their/) [billboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ilhck2/saw_one_in_the_wild_make_sure_to_vote_illinois/), [blog posts](https://redditblog.com/2020/09/01/its-national-poll-worker-recruitment-day-become-a-poll-worker-this-election-and-help-power-the-polls-in-your-community/), and [AMAs](https://redditblog.com/2020/08/25/voting-in-america/), we’re doing our best to encourage people on and off Reddit to vote this year. Along with our [Up the Vote campaign](https://redditblog.com/2020/07/29/up-the-vote-reddits-irl-2020-voting-campaign/) and [ongoing security and safety work](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/) to guard against shenanigans, we’ve also been evolving how we handle another important aspect of the election process: **political ads**.

## First, some background

Political ads have been a relatively quiet part of Reddit for many years. Last year, in thinking through what the right balance was between unfettered political ads and prohibiting them altogether for 2020 (both approaches that other platforms have taken), we decided on [a policy we felt was the best approach for Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/g0s6tn/changes_to_reddits_political_ads_policy/): no misinformation, human review of the ads and where they link, a subreddit listing all political ads ([r/RedditPoliticalAds](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditPoliticalAds/)), and a requirement to keep comments on for 24 hours.

Since debuting this policy earlier this year, the last condition (requiring comments to remain on) has enabled redditors to discuss political ads—providing more context in the comments and even offering counterarguments—but so far it’s only been lightly used. As we get closer to November, however, the prominence of and discussion around political ads will increase, and, with it, the need for a clear moderation system for these comments.

## The problem we’re addressing

As I mentioned [a couple months back](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/fwdxoty/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3&depth=2), unmoderated spaces on Reddit are an area we want to improve, from Modmail to PM’s, and political ads pose a unique challenge.

If the OP of a political ad (i.e., a campaign) moderates the comments, it’s problematic: they might remove dissenting perspectives. And if we (the admins) moderate the comments of a political ad, it’s even more problematic, putting us in the position of either moderating too much or too little, with inevitable accusations of bias either way.

The problem, we realized, is similar to what we see in r/announcements: lots of people commenting on a highly visible post outside the context of a community. It’s fair to say that r/announcements isn’t really a community; it lacks the culture, cohesion, and moderation that benefit most other subreddits, and as a result, the quality of conversation has deteriorated as the audience has grown.

Ultimately, conversations really only happen in the context of a community, and neither r/announcements nor political ads with comments on provide this. We believe we can foster better discussion on both with a different approach.

## What we’re testing today

Instead of having the usual free-for-all of comments on the r/announcements post itself, we are trying out a new experience today that encourages discussion of this post within other communities—an approach we hope works for political ads as well.

Below is a stickied comment with a link to submit this post to other communities on Reddit and a list of those discussion posts. The stickied comment will update automatically with new posts.

A few other details to note for this test:

* **The discussion posts are like any other post**, which means they can be voted on by users and removed by mods.
* **Communities that don’t want to participate don’t have to.** (If you’re a mod of a community where a user attempts to crosspost this, you will get a Modmail alerting you to this with [opt-out instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/).)
* **Individual community rules apply to these posts just as any other**, so read the rules before attempting to bring the discussion into a completely unrelated community.
* **Our stickied comment will link to discussions only from communities subject to our ads allow list.** Communities that have already opted not to appear in r/all won’t appear in the comment either, even if there is a discussion of this post there.
* **After today’s test, we will likely test this system with political ads.**

This test will be a success if there are a variety of posts and conversations about this post, even—and perhaps particularly—if they are critical.

## How we’re answering questions

r/announcements posts have an important difference from political ads: I treat them as AMAs and do my best to answer questions and respond to criticism (both of which I appreciate). With this approach, I expect doing so will be more difficult (at least this first time). However, the point of this test is not to make you hunt for our answers or for us to reply to fewer questions, and we don’t intend to use this approach for all our admin posts (e.g., in r/ModNews, r/changelog, r/ModSupport, and others, which are smaller subreddits that still work well).

For today, we’re going to make the first link of this post to r/ModNews and start by answering mods’ questions there. In a future announcement, we may ask a specific community if they would host us for the discussion that day (depending on what the announcement is) and set that as an official destination for discussion, like a regular AMA.

Additionally, I’ll do my best to find other places to respond, and we’ll maintain another comment below this post to list replies we’ve given outside of r/announcements so you can easily find our responses (which was a feature request from [our post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/g3r4xpm/) last week).

Ultimately, the goal of this test is to enable Reddit to do what Reddit does best: facilitate conversations (within the context of a community), provide commentary on political ads the way redditors already do on news and politics daily (sharing more information and calling bullshit in the comments when necessary), and extend the discussion well beyond the scope of the original post.

Thank you for participating. We hope this approach sets the stage for successful commentary not just today but down the road on political ads as well.

**Edit (9/28/20):** Update: After initial testing and a few small tweaks to the sorting and score display of the links in stickied comments like the one below, we’ll be using this discussion system on political ads moving forward. 

As I mentioned, our goal with this approach was to encourage these types of discussions to happen within the context of a community. While this feature is completely optional for communities (opt-out instructions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/)), we were pleased overall with the level of engagement that we saw from communities and users on this test post.

We’re still exploring how we’ll use this feature for r/announcements posts and how we can work with specific communities to have discussions about them.

Update to Our Content Policy,spez,21314,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/,38595,"[A few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/), we committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate. After talking extensively with mods, outside organizations, and our own teams, we’re updating our content policy today and enforcing it (with your help).

## First, a quick recap

Since our last post, here’s what we’ve been doing:

* **We brought on a** [**new Board member**](https://redditblog.com/2020/06/10/reddit-welcomes-michael-seibel-to-board-of-directors/).
* **We held policy calls with mods**—both from established Mod Councils and from communities disproportionately targeted with hate—and discussed areas where we can do better to action bad actors, clarify our policies, make mods' lives easier, and concretely reduce hate.
   * You can find [detailed notes from our All-Council mod call here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hi3nkr/the_mod_conversations_that_went_into_todays), including specific product work we discussed.
* **We developed our enforcement plan**, including both our immediate actions (e.g., today’s bans) and long-term investments (tackling the most critical work discussed in our mod calls, sustainably enforcing the new policies, and advancing Reddit’s community governance).

From our conversations with mods and outside experts, it’s clear that while we’ve gotten better in some areas—like actioning violations at the community level, [scaling enforcement efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/hbiuas/reddit_security_report_june_18_2020/), measurably reducing hateful experiences like harassment [year over year](https://www.adl.org/online-hate-2020#results)—we still have a long way to go to address the gaps in our policies and enforcement to date.

These include addressing questions our policies have left unanswered (like whether hate speech is allowed or even protected on Reddit), aspects of our product and mod tools that are still too easy for individual bad actors to abuse (inboxes, chats, modmail), and areas where we can do better to partner with our mods and communities who want to combat the same hateful conduct we do.

Ultimately, it’s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. In the near term, this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.

## New Policy

This is the [new content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). Here’s what’s different:

* It starts with a statement of our vision for Reddit and our communities, including the basic expectations we have for all communities and users.
* **Rule 1** explicitly states that communities and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.
   * There is an expanded definition of what constitutes a violation of this rule, along with specific examples, in our [Help Center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).
* **Rule 2** ties together our previous rules on prohibited behavior with an ask to abide by community rules and post with authentic, personal interest.
   * Debate and creativity are welcome, but spam and malicious attempts to interfere with other communities are not.
* The other rules are the same in spirit but have been rewritten for clarity and inclusiveness.

Alongside the change to the content policy, we are initially banning about 2000 subreddits, the vast majority of which are inactive. Of these communities, about [200](https://www.redditstatic.com/banned-subreddits-june-2020.txt) have more than 10 daily users. Both r/The_Donald and r/ChapoTrapHouse were included.

All communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so, despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1), antagonized us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8), and its mods have refused to meet our most basic expectations. Until now, we’ve worked in good faith to help them preserve the community as a space for its users—through warnings, mod changes, quarantining, and more.

Though smaller, r/ChapoTrapHouse was banned for similar reasons: They consistently host rule-breaking content and their mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.

To be clear, views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit—but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith, without exception.

## Our commitment

Our policies will never be perfect, with new edge cases that inevitably lead us to evolve them in the future. And as users, you will always have more context, community vernacular, and cultural values to inform the standards set within your communities than we as site admins or any AI ever could.

But just as our content moderation cannot scale effectively without your support, you need more support from us as well, and we admit we have fallen short towards this end. We are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors, abusive behaviors, and toxic communities that undermine our mission and get in the way of the creativity, discussions, and communities that bring us all to Reddit in the first place. We hope that our progress towards this commitment, with today’s update and those to come, makes Reddit a place you enjoy and are proud to be a part of for many years to come.

Edit: After digesting feedback, we made a clarifying change to our help center article for [Promoting Hate Based on Identity or Vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).",1593450006.0,Text
"Upcoming changes to our content policy, our board, and where we’re going from here",spez,40924,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/,40768,"**TL;DR: We’re working with mods to change our content policy to explicitly address hate.** u/kn0thing **has resigned from our board to fill his seat with a Black candidate, a request we will honor. I want to take responsibility for the history of our policies over the years that got us here, and we still have work to do.**

After watching people across the country mourn and demand an end to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people, I wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it, a duty to speak out.

Earlier this week, I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, “How can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?”

These questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy. 

Over the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities—across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could’ve imagined when we first created subreddits—and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.

However, as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:

* Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. 
* Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. 
* Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.

We are already working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it’s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.

We will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn’t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.

And just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he’s done for us over the years.

At the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.

In the early days of Reddit, 2005–2006, our idealistic “policy” was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our “policy.” 

I left Reddit from 2010–2015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit’s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). 

When I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what’s acceptable on Reddit and what’s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were “making Reddit worse” but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. 

While we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity—and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules, but also isn’t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.

This inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, “Breaking Reddit” was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.

The majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. 

Despite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.

I will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.

Thanks,

Announcing a ban on AI generated videos (with a few exceptions),ianjm,1852,https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1cg9nud/announcing_a_ban_on_ai_generated_videos_with_a/,279,"Howdy r/videos,

We all know the robots are coming for our jobs and our lives - but now they're coming for our subreddit too.

Multiple videos that have weird scripts that sound like they've come straight out of a kindergartener's thesaurus now regularly show up in the new queue, and all of them voiced by those same slightly off-putting set of cheap or free AI voice clones that everyone is using.

Not only are they annoying, but 99 times out of 100 they are also just bad videos, and, unfortunately, there is a very large overlap between the sorts of people who want to use AI to make their Youtube video, and the sorts of people who'll pay for a botnet to upvote it on Reddit.

So, starting today, we're proposing a full ban on low effort AI generated content. As mods we often already remove these, but we don't catch them all. You will soon be able to report both posts and comments as 'AI' and we'll remove them.

There will, however, be a few small exceptions. **All of which must have the new AI flair applied** (_which we will sort out in the coming couple days - a little flair housekeeping to do first_).

Some examples:

- Use of the tech in collaboration with a strong human element, e.g. creating a cartoon where AI has been used to help generate the video element based on a human-written script. 
- Demonstrations the progress of the technology (e.g. [Introducing Sora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK6y8DAPN_0))
- Satire that is actually funny (e.g. [satirical adverts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSewd6Iaj6I), deepfakes that are obvious and amusing) - though remember Rule 2, NO POLITICS
- Artistic pieces that aren't just crummy visualisers 

All of this will be up to the r/videos denizens, if we see an AI piece in the new queue that meets the above exceptions and is getting strongly upvoted, so long as is properly identified, it can stay.

The vast majority of AI videos we've seen so far though, do not.

Thanks, we hope this makes sense.

**Feedback welcome! If you have any suggestions about this policy, or just want to call the mods a bunch of assholes, now is your chance.**",1714422897.0,Text

""July the 14th, 1861

Washington D.C.

My very dear Sarah:

The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days—perhaps tomorrow. Lest I should not be able to write you again, I feel impelled to write lines that may fall under your eye when I shall be no more.

Our movement may be one of a few days duration and full of pleasure—and it may be one of severe conflict and death to me. Not my will, but thine O God, be done. If it is necessary that I should fall on the battlefield for my country, I am ready. I have no misgivings about, or lack of confidence in, the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how strongly American Civilization now leans upon the triumph of the Government, and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the Revolution. And I am willing—perfectly willing—to lay down all my joys in this life, to help maintain this Government, and to pay that debt.


But, my dear wife, when I know that with my own joys I lay down nearly all of yours, and replace them in this life with cares and sorrows—when, after having eaten for long years the bitter fruit of orphanage myself, I must offer it as their only sustenance to my dear little children—is it weak or dishonorable, while the banner of my purpose floats calmly and proudly in the breeze, that my unbounded love for you, my darling wife and children, should struggle in fierce, though useless, contest with my love of country.

Sarah, my love for you is deathless, it seems to bind me to you with mighty cables that nothing but Omnipotence could break; and yet my love of Country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on with all these chains to the battlefield.

The memories of the blissful moments I have spent with you come creeping over me, and I feel most gratified to God and to you that I have enjoyed them so long. And hard it is for me to give them up and burn to ashes the hopes of future years, when God willing, we might still have lived and loved together and seen our sons grow up to honorable manhood around us. I have, I know, but few and small claims upon Divine Providence, but something whispers to me—perhaps it is the wafted prayer of my little Edgar—that I shall return to my loved ones unharmed. If I do not, my dear Sarah, never forget how much I love you, and when my last breath escapes me on the battlefield, it will whisper your name.

Forgive my many faults, and the many pains I have caused you. How thoughtless and foolish I have often been! How gladly would I wash out with my tears every little spot upon your happiness, and struggle with all the misfortune of this world, to shield you and my children from harm. But I cannot. I must watch you from the spirit land and hover near you, while you buffet the storms with your precious little freight, and wait with sad patience till we meet to part no more.

But, O Sarah! If the dead can come back to this earth and flit unseen around those they loved, I shall always be near you; in the brightest day and in the darkest night—amidst your happiest scenes and gloomiest hours—always, always; and if there be a soft breeze upon your cheek, it shall be my breath; or the cool air fans your throbbing temple, it shall be my spirit passing by.

Sarah, do not mourn me dead; think I am gone and wait for thee, for we shall meet again.
As for my little boys, they will grow as I have done, and never know a father's love and care. Little Willie is too young to remember me long, and my blue-eyed Edgar will keep my frolics with him among the dimmest memories of his childhood. Sarah, I have unlimited confidence in your maternal care and your development of their characters. Tell my two mothers his and hers I call God's blessing upon them. O Sarah, I wait for you there! Come to me, and lead thither my children.

Forging A Return to Productive Conversation: An Open Letter to Reddit,Funny_Sentinel,1193,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/14jmh7e/forging_a_return_to_productive_conversation_an/,1,"To All Whom It May Concern:

For fifteen years, /r/Funny has been one of Reddit’s most-popular communities. That time hasn’t been without its difficulties, but for the most part, we’ve all gotten along (with each other and with administrators). Members of our team fondly remember Moderator Roadshows, visits to Reddit’s headquarters, Reddit Secret Santa, April Fools’ Day events, regional meetups, and many more uplifting moments. We’ve watched this platform grow by leaps and bounds, and although we haven’t been completely happy about every change that we’ve witnessed, we’ve always done our best to work with Reddit at finding ways to adapt, compromise, and move forward. 

This process has occasionally been preceded by some exceptionally public debate, however.

On June 12th, 2023, /r/Funny joined thousands of other subreddits in protesting the planned changes to Reddit’s API; changes which – despite being immediately evident to only a minority of Redditors – threatened to worsen the site for everyone. By June 16th, 2023, that demonstration had evolved to represent a wider (and growing) array of concerns, many of which arose in response to [Reddit’s statements to journalists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/16/reddit-ceo-blackout-moderators-steve-huffman/). Today (June 26th, 2023), we are hopeful that users and administrators alike can make a return to the productive dialogue that has served us in the past. 

We acknowledge that Reddit has placed itself in a situation that makes adjusting its current API roadmap impossible. 

However, we have the following requests:

- Commit to exploring ways by which third-party applications can make an affordable return.
- Commit to providing moderation tools and [accessibility options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/) (on Old Reddit, New Reddit, and mobile platforms) which match or exceed the functionality and utility of third-party applications.
- Commit to prioritizing a significant reduction in spam, misinformation, bigotry, and illegal content on Reddit.
- Guarantee that any future developments which may impact moderators, contributors, or stakeholders will be announced no less than one fiscal quarter before they are scheduled to go into effect.
- Work together with longstanding moderators to establish a reasonable roadmap and deadline for accomplishing all of the above.
- Affirm that efforts meant to keep Reddit accountable to its commitments and deadlines will hereafter not be met with insults, threats, removals, or hostility.
- Publicly affirm all of the above by way of updating Reddit’s User Agreement and Reddit’s Moderator Code of Conduct to include reasonable expectations and requirements for administrators’ behavior. 
- Implement and fill a senior-level role (with decision-making and policy-shaping power) of ""Moderator Advocate"" at Reddit, with a required qualification for the position being robust experience as a volunteer Reddit moderator.

Reddit is unique amongst social-media sites in that its lifeblood – its multitude of moderators and contributors – consists entirely of volunteers. We populate and curate the platform’s many communities, thereby providing a welcoming and engaging environment for all of its visitors. We receive little in the way of thanks for these efforts, but we frequently endure abuse, threats, attacks, and exposure to truly reprehensible media. Historically, we have trusted that Reddit’s administrators have the best interests of the platform and its users (be they moderators, contributors, participants, or lurkers) at heart; that while Reddit may be a for-profit company, it nonetheless recognizes and appreciates the value that Redditors provide. 

That trust has been all but entirely eroded… but we hope that together, we can begin to rebuild it.

In simplest terms, Reddit, we implore you: **Remember the human**. 

We look forward to your response by Thursday, June 29th, 2023.

Throughout the pandemic, we have also provided COVID-related resources to support our volunteer moderators, users, and communities, including a dedicated AMA series connecting users with [authoritative experts on coronavirus](https://redditblog.com/2020/03/02/expert-conversation-on-coronavirus/) and [vaccines](https://redditblog.com/2021/01/28/introducing-a-new-reddit-ama-series-everything-you-want-to-know-about-covid-19-vaccines/), as well as deploying homepage and search page banners directing users to the CDC and r/Coronavirus.

We appreciate that not everyone agrees with the current approach to getting us all through the pandemic, and some are still wary of vaccinations. Dissent is a part of Reddit and the foundation of democracy. Reddit is a place for open and authentic discussion and debate. This includes conversations that question or disagree with popular consensus. This includes conversations that criticize those that disagree with the majority opinion. This includes protests that criticize or object to our decisions on which communities to ban from the platform.

While we appreciate the sentiment of those demanding that we ban more communities that challenge consensus views on the pandemic, we continue to believe in the good of our communities and hope that we collectively approach the challenges of the pandemic with empathy, compassion, and a willingness to understand what others are going through, even when their viewpoint on the pandemic is different from yours. 

When it comes to COVID-19 specifically, what we know and what are the current best practices from authoritative sources, like the CDC, evolve continuously with new learnings. Given the rapid state of change, we believe it is best to enable communities to engage in debate and dissent, and for us to link to the CDC wherever appropriate. While we believe the CDC is the best and most up to date source of information regarding COVID-19, disagreeing with them is not against our policies.

However, manipulating or cheating Reddit to amplify any particular viewpoint is against our policies, and we will continue to action communities that do so or that violate any of our other rules, including those dedicated to fraud (e.g. fake vaccine cards) or encouraging harm (e.g. consuming bleach); and we will continue to use our quarantine tool to link to authoritative sources and warn people they may encounter unsound advice. We humbly ask and encourage everyone to report content that may violate our policies.

We will continue to run exchanges through the end of the year -- including the last ever Arbitrary Day (signups are [now open](https://www.redditgifts.com/exchanges/a-day-21/)) -- and will end with Secret Santa 2021. 

**We didn’t make this decision lightly.** 

We made the difficult decision to shut down Reddit Gifts and put more focus on enhancing the [user experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/mqcpcg/you_want_a_better_reddit_search_ok_were_on_it/) on Reddit - this includes [investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/ldgmfc/diamond_hands_on_the_data/) in the [foundation](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/nudfv1/the_rollout_of_reputation_service/) [of our](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/lb2p7a/a_new_video_player_updated_email_designs_mobile/) [platform](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/neknjg/evolving_beyond_100_billion_recommendations_a_day/) and [moderator tools](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/nk7p7j/new_updates_to_help_moderators_your_monthly/), making it more [accessible](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/mzse3p/control_over_your_followers_spring_avatar_gear_a/) for people around the world and evolving how people [engage](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/nmhmj0/q1_safety_security_report_may_27_2021/) with one another. 

The power of Reddit Gifts was never in the software, and has always belonged to the r/secretsanta community of gifters around the world, which has connected people and been an extension of our mission to bring community and belonging to everyone in the world. We’re hopeful that spirit will continue in the future. 

**What this means for future exchanges in 2021**

In preparation for retiring Reddit Gifts after the final exchange at the end of 2021, we will be taking the following actions: 

* In order to limit incomplete exchanges, we have disabled the creation of any new Reddit Gifts accounts. If you have an existing Reddit Gifts account, we would love it if you would participate with us in these final exchanges. 
* Any incomplete exchanges will result in a ban from the remaining Reddit Gifts exchanges.
* This morning, we turned off the ability to buy [Elves](https://www.redditgifts.com/Elves/). If you purchased an Elves membership and have remaining months after the 2021 Secret Santa Exchange, we will email you about your refund options then. If you have specific concerns about your Elves membership, please reach out to Reddit Gifts [support](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000825092). 

These changes have been put in place to ensure that these last exchanges are enjoyable for the legacy Reddit Gifts users. We want to celebrate the end of Reddit Gifts with the community that we’ve built so far. 

Countless acts of love, heroism, compassion, support, growth and hilarity happened through Reddit Gifts, and those memories will live on in the hearts of our community. We’re working on ways to capture these moments and look forward to seeing how the spirit and connection of exchanging gifts with strangers will live on.

As of today, the employee in question is no longer employed by Reddit. We built a relationship with her first as a mod and then through her contractor work on RPAN. We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her. 

We’ve put significant effort into improving how we handle doxxing and harassment, and this employee was the subject of both. In this case, we over-indexed on protection, which had serious consequences in terms of enforcement actions. 

* On March 9th, we added extra protections for this employee, including actioning content that mentioned the employee’s name or shared personal information on third-party sites, which we reserve for serious cases of harassment and doxxing.
* On March 22nd, a news article about this employee was posted by a mod of r/ukpolitics. The article was removed and the submitter banned by the aforementioned rules. When contacted by the moderators of r/ukpolitics, we reviewed the actions, and reversed the ban on the moderator, and we informed the r/ukpolitics moderation team that we had restored the mod.
* We updated our rules to flag potential harassment for human review.

Debate and criticism have always been and always will be central to conversation on Reddit—including discussion about public figures and Reddit itself—as long as they are not used as vehicles for harassment. Mentioning a public figure’s name should not get you banned.

We care deeply for Reddit and appreciate that you do too. We understand the anger and confusion about these issues and their bigger implications. The employee is no longer with Reddit, and we’ll be evolving a number of relevant internal policies.

Today we’re testing a new way to discuss political ads (and announcements),spez,17317,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/ipitt0/today_were_testing_a_new_way_to_discuss_political/,2,"In case you missed [the](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/ikxsst/this_reddit_billboard_advertisement_for_their/) [billboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ilhck2/saw_one_in_the_wild_make_sure_to_vote_illinois/), [blog posts](https://redditblog.com/2020/09/01/its-national-poll-worker-recruitment-day-become-a-poll-worker-this-election-and-help-power-the-polls-in-your-community/), and [AMAs](https://redditblog.com/2020/08/25/voting-in-america/), we’re doing our best to encourage people on and off Reddit to vote this year. Along with our [Up the Vote campaign](https://redditblog.com/2020/07/29/up-the-vote-reddits-irl-2020-voting-campaign/) and [ongoing security and safety work](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/) to guard against shenanigans, we’ve also been evolving how we handle another important aspect of the election process: **political ads**.

## First, some background

Political ads have been a relatively quiet part of Reddit for many years. Last year, in thinking through what the right balance was between unfettered political ads and prohibiting them altogether for 2020 (both approaches that other platforms have taken), we decided on [a policy we felt was the best approach for Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/g0s6tn/changes_to_reddits_political_ads_policy/): no misinformation, human review of the ads and where they link, a subreddit listing all political ads ([r/RedditPoliticalAds](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditPoliticalAds/)), and a requirement to keep comments on for 24 hours.

Since debuting this policy earlier this year, the last condition (requiring comments to remain on) has enabled redditors to discuss political ads—providing more context in the comments and even offering counterarguments—but so far it’s only been lightly used. As we get closer to November, however, the prominence of and discussion around political ads will increase, and, with it, the need for a clear moderation system for these comments.

## The problem we’re addressing

As I mentioned [a couple months back](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/fwdxoty/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3&depth=2), unmoderated spaces on Reddit are an area we want to improve, from Modmail to PM’s, and political ads pose a unique challenge.

If the OP of a political ad (i.e., a campaign) moderates the comments, it’s problematic: they might remove dissenting perspectives. And if we (the admins) moderate the comments of a political ad, it’s even more problematic, putting us in the position of either moderating too much or too little, with inevitable accusations of bias either way.

The problem, we realized, is similar to what we see in r/announcements: lots of people commenting on a highly visible post outside the context of a community. It’s fair to say that r/announcements isn’t really a community; it lacks the culture, cohesion, and moderation that benefit most other subreddits, and as a result, the quality of conversation has deteriorated as the audience has grown.

Ultimately, conversations really only happen in the context of a community, and neither r/announcements nor political ads with comments on provide this. We believe we can foster better discussion on both with a different approach.

## What we’re testing today

Instead of having the usual free-for-all of comments on the r/announcements post itself, we are trying out a new experience today that encourages discussion of this post within other communities—an approach we hope works for political ads as well.

Below is a stickied comment with a link to submit this post to other communities on Reddit and a list of those discussion posts. The stickied comment will update automatically with new posts.

A few other details to note for this test:

* **The discussion posts are like any other post**, which means they can be voted on by users and removed by mods.
* **Communities that don’t want to participate don’t have to.** (If you’re a mod of a community where a user attempts to crosspost this, you will get a Modmail alerting you to this with [opt-out instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/).)
* **Individual community rules apply to these posts just as any other**, so read the rules before attempting to bring the discussion into a completely unrelated community.
* **Our stickied comment will link to discussions only from communities subject to our ads allow list.** Communities that have already opted not to appear in r/all won’t appear in the comment either, even if there is a discussion of this post there.
* **After today’s test, we will likely test this system with political ads.**

This test will be a success if there are a variety of posts and conversations about this post, even—and perhaps particularly—if they are critical.

## How we’re answering questions

r/announcements posts have an important difference from political ads: I treat them as AMAs and do my best to answer questions and respond to criticism (both of which I appreciate). With this approach, I expect doing so will be more difficult (at least this first time). However, the point of this test is not to make you hunt for our answers or for us to reply to fewer questions, and we don’t intend to use this approach for all our admin posts (e.g., in r/ModNews, r/changelog, r/ModSupport, and others, which are smaller subreddits that still work well).

For today, we’re going to make the first link of this post to r/ModNews and start by answering mods’ questions there. In a future announcement, we may ask a specific community if they would host us for the discussion that day (depending on what the announcement is) and set that as an official destination for discussion, like a regular AMA.

Additionally, I’ll do my best to find other places to respond, and we’ll maintain another comment below this post to list replies we’ve given outside of r/announcements so you can easily find our responses (which was a feature request from [our post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/g3r4xpm/) last week).

Ultimately, the goal of this test is to enable Reddit to do what Reddit does best: facilitate conversations (within the context of a community), provide commentary on political ads the way redditors already do on news and politics daily (sharing more information and calling bullshit in the comments when necessary), and extend the discussion well beyond the scope of the original post.

Thank you for participating. We hope this approach sets the stage for successful commentary not just today but down the road on political ads as well.

**Edit (9/28/20):** Update: After initial testing and a few small tweaks to the sorting and score display of the links in stickied comments like the one below, we’ll be using this discussion system on political ads moving forward. 

As I mentioned, our goal with this approach was to encourage these types of discussions to happen within the context of a community. While this feature is completely optional for communities (opt-out instructions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/)), we were pleased overall with the level of engagement that we saw from communities and users on this test post.

We’re still exploring how we’ll use this feature for r/announcements posts and how we can work with specific communities to have discussions about them.

Update to Our Content Policy,spez,21321,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/,38595,"[A few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/), we committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate. After talking extensively with mods, outside organizations, and our own teams, we’re updating our content policy today and enforcing it (with your help).

## First, a quick recap

Since our last post, here’s what we’ve been doing:

* **We brought on a** [**new Board member**](https://redditblog.com/2020/06/10/reddit-welcomes-michael-seibel-to-board-of-directors/).
* **We held policy calls with mods**—both from established Mod Councils and from communities disproportionately targeted with hate—and discussed areas where we can do better to action bad actors, clarify our policies, make mods' lives easier, and concretely reduce hate.
   * You can find [detailed notes from our All-Council mod call here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hi3nkr/the_mod_conversations_that_went_into_todays), including specific product work we discussed.
* **We developed our enforcement plan**, including both our immediate actions (e.g., today’s bans) and long-term investments (tackling the most critical work discussed in our mod calls, sustainably enforcing the new policies, and advancing Reddit’s community governance).

From our conversations with mods and outside experts, it’s clear that while we’ve gotten better in some areas—like actioning violations at the community level, [scaling enforcement efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/hbiuas/reddit_security_report_june_18_2020/), measurably reducing hateful experiences like harassment [year over year](https://www.adl.org/online-hate-2020#results)—we still have a long way to go to address the gaps in our policies and enforcement to date.

These include addressing questions our policies have left unanswered (like whether hate speech is allowed or even protected on Reddit), aspects of our product and mod tools that are still too easy for individual bad actors to abuse (inboxes, chats, modmail), and areas where we can do better to partner with our mods and communities who want to combat the same hateful conduct we do.

Ultimately, it’s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. In the near term, this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.

## New Policy

This is the [new content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). Here’s what’s different:

* It starts with a statement of our vision for Reddit and our communities, including the basic expectations we have for all communities and users.
* **Rule 1** explicitly states that communities and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.
   * There is an expanded definition of what constitutes a violation of this rule, along with specific examples, in our [Help Center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).
* **Rule 2** ties together our previous rules on prohibited behavior with an ask to abide by community rules and post with authentic, personal interest.
   * Debate and creativity are welcome, but spam and malicious attempts to interfere with other communities are not.
* The other rules are the same in spirit but have been rewritten for clarity and inclusiveness.

Alongside the change to the content policy, we are initially banning about 2000 subreddits, the vast majority of which are inactive. Of these communities, about [200](https://www.redditstatic.com/banned-subreddits-june-2020.txt) have more than 10 daily users. Both r/The_Donald and r/ChapoTrapHouse were included.

All communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so, despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1), antagonized us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8), and its mods have refused to meet our most basic expectations. Until now, we’ve worked in good faith to help them preserve the community as a space for its users—through warnings, mod changes, quarantining, and more.

Though smaller, r/ChapoTrapHouse was banned for similar reasons: They consistently host rule-breaking content and their mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.

To be clear, views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit—but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith, without exception.

## Our commitment

Our policies will never be perfect, with new edge cases that inevitably lead us to evolve them in the future. And as users, you will always have more context, community vernacular, and cultural values to inform the standards set within your communities than we as site admins or any AI ever could.

But just as our content moderation cannot scale effectively without your support, you need more support from us as well, and we admit we have fallen short towards this end. We are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors, abusive behaviors, and toxic communities that undermine our mission and get in the way of the creativity, discussions, and communities that bring us all to Reddit in the first place. We hope that our progress towards this commitment, with today’s update and those to come, makes Reddit a place you enjoy and are proud to be a part of for many years to come.

Edit: After digesting feedback, we made a clarifying change to our help center article for [Promoting Hate Based on Identity or Vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).",1593450006.0,Text
"Upcoming changes to our content policy, our board, and where we’re going from here",spez,40935,https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/,40768,"**TL;DR: We’re working with mods to change our content policy to explicitly address hate.** u/kn0thing **has resigned from our board to fill his seat with a Black candidate, a request we will honor. I want to take responsibility for the history of our policies over the years that got us here, and we still have work to do.**

After watching people across the country mourn and demand an end to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people, I wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it, a duty to speak out.

Earlier this week, I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, “How can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?”

These questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy. 

Over the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities—across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could’ve imagined when we first created subreddits—and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.

However, as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:

* Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. 
* Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. 
* Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.

We are already working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it’s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.

We will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn’t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.

And just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he’s done for us over the years.

At the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.

In the early days of Reddit, 2005–2006, our idealistic “policy” was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our “policy.” 

I left Reddit from 2010–2015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit’s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). 

When I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what’s acceptable on Reddit and what’s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were “making Reddit worse” but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. 

While we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity—and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules, but also isn’t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.

This inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, “Breaking Reddit” was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.

The majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. 

Despite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.

I will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.

Forging A Return to Productive Conversation: An Open Letter to Reddit,Funny_Sentinel,1193,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/14jmh7e/forging_a_return_to_productive_conversation_an/,1,"To All Whom It May Concern:

For fifteen years, /r/Funny has been one of Reddit’s most-popular communities. That time hasn’t been without its difficulties, but for the most part, we’ve all gotten along (with each other and with administrators). Members of our team fondly remember Moderator Roadshows, visits to Reddit’s headquarters, Reddit Secret Santa, April Fools’ Day events, regional meetups, and many more uplifting moments. We’ve watched this platform grow by leaps and bounds, and although we haven’t been completely happy about every change that we’ve witnessed, we’ve always done our best to work with Reddit at finding ways to adapt, compromise, and move forward. 

This process has occasionally been preceded by some exceptionally public debate, however.

On June 12th, 2023, /r/Funny joined thousands of other subreddits in protesting the planned changes to Reddit’s API; changes which – despite being immediately evident to only a minority of Redditors – threatened to worsen the site for everyone. By June 16th, 2023, that demonstration had evolved to represent a wider (and growing) array of concerns, many of which arose in response to [Reddit’s statements to journalists](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/16/reddit-ceo-blackout-moderators-steve-huffman/). Today (June 26th, 2023), we are hopeful that users and administrators alike can make a return to the productive dialogue that has served us in the past. 

We acknowledge that Reddit has placed itself in a situation that makes adjusting its current API roadmap impossible. 

However, we have the following requests:

- Commit to exploring ways by which third-party applications can make an affordable return.
- Commit to providing moderation tools and [accessibility options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/) (on Old Reddit, New Reddit, and mobile platforms) which match or exceed the functionality and utility of third-party applications.
- Commit to prioritizing a significant reduction in spam, misinformation, bigotry, and illegal content on Reddit.
- Guarantee that any future developments which may impact moderators, contributors, or stakeholders will be announced no less than one fiscal quarter before they are scheduled to go into effect.
- Work together with longstanding moderators to establish a reasonable roadmap and deadline for accomplishing all of the above.
- Affirm that efforts meant to keep Reddit accountable to its commitments and deadlines will hereafter not be met with insults, threats, removals, or hostility.
- Publicly affirm all of the above by way of updating Reddit’s User Agreement and Reddit’s Moderator Code of Conduct to include reasonable expectations and requirements for administrators’ behavior. 
- Implement and fill a senior-level role (with decision-making and policy-shaping power) of ""Moderator Advocate"" at Reddit, with a required qualification for the position being robust experience as a volunteer Reddit moderator.

Reddit is unique amongst social-media sites in that its lifeblood – its multitude of moderators and contributors – consists entirely of volunteers. We populate and curate the platform’s many communities, thereby providing a welcoming and engaging environment for all of its visitors. We receive little in the way of thanks for these efforts, but we frequently endure abuse, threats, attacks, and exposure to truly reprehensible media. Historically, we have trusted that Reddit’s administrators have the best interests of the platform and its users (be they moderators, contributors, participants, or lurkers) at heart; that while Reddit may be a for-profit company, it nonetheless recognizes and appreciates the value that Redditors provide. 

That trust has been all but entirely eroded… but we hope that together, we can begin to rebuild it.

In simplest terms, Reddit, we implore you: **Remember the human**. 

We look forward to your response by Thursday, June 29th, 2023.

Godzilla 2014 deserved better sequels.,maruhadapurpurine,264,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1d5yorj/godzilla_2014_deserved_better_sequels/,121,"I finally got around to watching those monsterverse movies this week and boy... how did they manage to peak right at the start?

The 2014 movie is so vastly above the sequels in tone and quality that it's hard to believe they belong in the same continuity. Godzilla 2014 is as grounded as a story about a giant lizard monster fighting other giant monsters can be. The human element is much simpler and easier to empathize with. The effects feel years ahead of what came after too. The destruction caused by the monsters fighting feel appropriately bleak while also being super awesome to watch.

I don't think any moment in the sequels ever got me nearly as hyped as when Godzilla shoots his atomic breath down the MUTO's throat. Hell even his first full appearance at Hawaii got me more hyped than anything in the sequels to be honest.

Yeah, I will be the first to agree that for a Godzilla movie there isn't nearly enough Godzilla in it, but maybe they were on to something by keeping his presence so brief until later. The sequels have monsters galore and they're no better for it.

The whole time watching King of the Monsters I was only ever mildly amused by all of it. Gidorah just looked goofy as fuck most of the time because it clashes so much with the semi realism that Godzilla was designed with. The human plot is absolutely awful and should have been cut down by a lot.

Godzilla vs Kong is alright... Sure the fight scenes are cool, but once again the human characters detract way more than add anything to it, especially the podcast guy and the kids. Why are they even here? The stranger things girl's story was over already, why is she back?

And the sci-fi shit was already too much last movie, in this one they just jump the shark completely. It's like they couldn't figure out how to keep the story going so the movies just got progressively dumber with each entry, like a kid mashing toys together. Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy a movie like that, but when you compare it with the 2014 movie it is just so disappointing to see such a major departure in direction. It's like they lost the plot.

Kong Skull Island was fun though. Nice twist to have Samual L Jackson as the villain. I would rank this one just below Godzilla 2014. Even if the tone between them is still completely different at least Skull Island managed to keep itself together by succeeding in the same areas that Godzilla did. Straightforward, centered plot, the human characters contribute to the story instead of detracting from it, great action scenes.

The only one left is Godzilla x Kong and I'm already not expecting anything aside some dumb but fun fight scenes, and just hoping the human characters are cut down to a minimum.

On a side note I also watched Shin Godzilla and will watch Godzilla Minus One as well. The take is so different you can't even really compare them. Shin Godzilla is much more of a political commentary on the japanese government than anything else. I guess that keeps the line much closer to the OG Godzilla movie.

Edit: I finished watching Minus One and GxK The New Empire so here are my brief thoughts.

Minus One: Obviously not related to the monsterverse but it pretty much nails the human element in a Godzilla movie. Even when you know where te story is going it still hits the emotional notes. Because of that I would say it is overall better than the 2014 version (though I would still say that 2014 has better hype moments. You just can't top that atomic breath straight down the MUTO's mouth.)

GxK: This movie is completely ridiculous in every way possible and it just cemented my thoughts on this. Regardless of what I think about the quality of the sequels, these movies absolutely shouldn't be in the same universe. The tone is too different, the world is simply not the same. There is no way you can watch GxK and then look at 2014 Godzilla and say they fit together. It just doesn't work. Again, I'm not against movies like this. They have an audience, and I can honestly say I had some fun watching it, but it should've been its own thing and not related to the 2014 movie, which in turn deserved a sequel much more in line with its tone and vision of the Godzilla universe.",1717281094.0,Text

Godzilla 2014 deserved better sequels.,maruhadapurpurine,261,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1d5yorj/godzilla_2014_deserved_better_sequels/,122,"I finally got around to watching those monsterverse movies this week and boy... how did they manage to peak right at the start?

The 2014 movie is so vastly above the sequels in tone and quality that it's hard to believe they belong in the same continuity. Godzilla 2014 is as grounded as a story about a giant lizard monster fighting other giant monsters can be. The human element is much simpler and easier to empathize with. The effects feel years ahead of what came after too. The destruction caused by the monsters fighting feel appropriately bleak while also being super awesome to watch.

I don't think any moment in the sequels ever got me nearly as hyped as when Godzilla shoots his atomic breath down the MUTO's throat. Hell even his first full appearance at Hawaii got me more hyped than anything in the sequels to be honest.

Yeah, I will be the first to agree that for a Godzilla movie there isn't nearly enough Godzilla in it, but maybe they were on to something by keeping his presence so brief until later. The sequels have monsters galore and they're no better for it.

The whole time watching King of the Monsters I was only ever mildly amused by all of it. Gidorah just looked goofy as fuck most of the time because it clashes so much with the semi realism that Godzilla was designed with. The human plot is absolutely awful and should have been cut down by a lot.

Godzilla vs Kong is alright... Sure the fight scenes are cool, but once again the human characters detract way more than add anything to it, especially the podcast guy and the kids. Why are they even here? The stranger things girl's story was over already, why is she back?

And the sci-fi shit was already too much last movie, in this one they just jump the shark completely. It's like they couldn't figure out how to keep the story going so the movies just got progressively dumber with each entry, like a kid mashing toys together. Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy a movie like that, but when you compare it with the 2014 movie it is just so disappointing to see such a major departure in direction. It's like they lost the plot.

Kong Skull Island was fun though. Nice twist to have Samual L Jackson as the villain. I would rank this one just below Godzilla 2014. Even if the tone between them is still completely different at least Skull Island managed to keep itself together by succeeding in the same areas that Godzilla did. Straightforward, centered plot, the human characters contribute to the story instead of detracting from it, great action scenes.

The only one left is Godzilla x Kong and I'm already not expecting anything aside some dumb but fun fight scenes, and just hoping the human characters are cut down to a minimum.

On a side note I also watched Shin Godzilla and will watch Godzilla Minus One as well. The take is so different you can't even really compare them. Shin Godzilla is much more of a political commentary on the japanese government than anything else. I guess that keeps the line much closer to the OG Godzilla movie.

Edit: I finished watching Minus One and GxK The New Empire so here are my brief thoughts.

Minus One: Obviously not related to the monsterverse but it pretty much nails the human element in a Godzilla movie. Even when you know where te story is going it still hits the emotional notes. Because of that I would say it is overall better than the 2014 version (though I would still say that 2014 has better hype moments. You just can't top that atomic breath straight down the MUTO's mouth.)

GxK: This movie is completely ridiculous in every way possible and it just cemented my thoughts on this. Regardless of what I think about the quality of the sequels, these movies absolutely shouldn't be in the same universe. The tone is too different, the world is simply not the same. There is no way you can watch GxK and then look at 2014 Godzilla and say they fit together. It just doesn't work. Again, I'm not against movies like this. They have an audience, and I can honestly say I had some fun watching it, but it should've been its own thing and not related to the 2014 movie, which in turn deserved a sequel much more in line with its tone and vision of the Godzilla universe.",1717281094.0,Text

"80s nostalgia movies never get that hair right, especially the early 80s",JobberStable,197,https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1d5ygdf/80s_nostalgia_movies_never_get_that_hair_right/,96,"It seems like people's hair was bad back then. looking back at early 80s TV game shows and news reports with regular everyday people, women had dried out dead ends or some sort of helmet on their head. It seems like Movie producers wont fully commit to the look. I guess it comes off as either too comedic or too unattractive for the lead. Or maybe the female lead is like ""hell no, your not doing that to my hair!!' The best they will do is put on some dumb wig on a male actor or for a female actor just tease the ends a bit.

"Matrix, Terminator, and Heat contain some of the best action in movies.

And nothing wrong with it, it's just that most fans of great action movies have likely seen these. What are some lesser known but still pretty fun action sequences?",1717295001.0,Text
